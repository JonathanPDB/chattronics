Potentiometer (10kΩ, 180°) - This potentiometer acts as a transducer, converting the mechanical angle of the pendulum to a proportional electrical signal. The resistance changes as the pendulum swings, providing a voltage variation across the potentiometer.

Buffer (Op-Amp) - The buffer is an operational amplifier (op-amp) configured in a unity-gain mode. The objective of this stage is to provide a low impedance source to drive the following stages without loading the potentiometer. This helps to maintain signal integrity and prevent voltage drops due to impedance mismatches.

Low-Pass Filter (50/60Hz Notch) - This analog filter circuit is designed to suppress 50 and 60 Hz power line noise, which can be particularly problematic during signal acquisition. By ensuring these frequencies are damped, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved, leading to more accurate pendulum angle measurements.

Attenuator (Voltage Divider) - Since the DAQ can accept a maximum input voltage of +/- 7 V, and the potentiometer is powered with a -10 to 10 V supply, this stage attenuates the signal to ensure it falls within the DAQ input voltage range. It prevents clipping and potential damage to the DAQ system.

DAQ Interface (Analog to Digital) - This block represents the signal conditioning and conversion functions required to prepare the analog signal for digital acquisition. It may include additional scaling, buffering, and conversion to a digital signal compatible with the DAQ device.

DAQ System (LabVIEW Display) - The final block is the actual DAQ system, which samples the digital signal and interfaces with LabVIEW to display the measured pendulum angle. The DAQ system will have the necessary software drivers and hardware interfaces to allow real-time monitoring and possibly logging of the pendulum's angular position.

Low-Pass Filter

Given the lack of specific requirements, I will suggest filtering topologies that are commonly used in applications similar to yours, where precision angle measurement is critical, and power line noise must be mitigated.

The signal bandwidth needed to accurately measure the pendulum's angle is typically low, as the pendulum swing frequency is much lower than noise frequencies. Therefore, a simple low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency below 50 Hz could be sufficient. This would attenuate noise frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz effectively, while preserving the signal from the potentiometer related to the pendulum's motion.

Since the exact noise attenuation level is not specified, a standard goal is to attenuate 50 and 60 Hz noise by at least 40 dB, which would result in noise levels 100 times lower in power than the desired signal.

For the filter topology, I suggest considering the following two options:
1. A passive RC (Resistor-capacitor) low-pass filter: This is the simplest solution, requiring no power supply, but it has limitations in terms of performance and cannot drive low impedance loads without signal degradation.
2. An active low-pass filter using an operational amplifier (Op-Amp): This will provide better performance, with more precise cutoff frequencies and higher input/output impedances. It can also be configured to provide some gain if needed.

For an active filter, a second-order (two-pole) Sallen-Key topology can be used. This is a good compromise between complexity and filtering performance. A second-order filter provides a rolloff rate of 12 dB/octave (or 40 dB/decade).

For the given project, I suggest the following specifications:
- Filter type: Active low-pass filter
- Topology: Sallen-Key
- Filter order: Second-order
- Cutoff frequency: 40 Hz (to ensure a buffer below the 50 Hz noise)
- Component values: These would need to be calculated based on the chosen Op-Amp characteristics and power supply. However, for a 40 Hz cutoff, assuming a unity-gain Sallen-Key configuration with equal capacitors (C1 = C2), and using standard 10% tolerance components, typical values might be C1 = C2 = 0.1 µF and R1 = R2 = approximately 40 kΩ.

Please note that the values above are an initial estimation. The exact resistor and capacitor values should be selected based on the availability of components and may require fine-tuning. Additionally, the Op-Amp should be chosen for low noise and low offset voltage to maintain signal integrity.

If you are not equipped to fine-tune the filter, an alternative approach would be to use a ready-made filter module or a programmable filter IC that can be adjusted to meet the exact requirements without needing to calculate and test individual component values.

ATTENUATOR BLOCK

SOLUTION:
Given the expected voltage range from the potentiometer (0 to 10 Volts) and the maximum accepted input voltage for the DAQ (+/- 7 Volts), an attenuator is required to scale down the voltage to a suitable level. Since we do not have specifics regarding adjustability, space constraints, or additional features such as overvoltage protection, a simple fixed ratio voltage divider will be suggested.

The voltage divider can be designed using two resistors, R1 and R2, connected in series across the potentiometer voltage output. The junction of these resistors provides the attenuated voltage output to the DAQ system.

To calculate the values of R1 and R2, we can use the formula:

Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2))

Where Vout is the maximum output voltage for the DAQ (7 Volts), and Vin is the maximum output voltage of the potentiometer (10 Volts). Let's choose R2 to be 10 kOhms, which makes it a good match with the potentiometer's resistance.

7V = 10V * (R2 / (R1 + R2))

Solving for R1 gives us:

R1 = R2 * [(Vin/Vout) - 1] = 10 kOhms * [(10V/7V) - 1] ≈ 4.29 kOhms

Choosing a standard resistor value, we can use R1 = 4.3 kOhms.

The final configuration would be:

- R1 = 4.3 kOhms
- R2 = 10 kOhms

TOPOLOGY:
The topology of the attenuator block is a straightforward voltage divider, consisting of two resistors (R1 and R2) in series.

It is essential to note that the actual values may need fine-tuning based on the specific characteristics of the DAQ system once that information is available. Additionally, if adjustability is required, a trimpot could be used in place of one of the resistors to allow for calibration. If overvoltage protection is a concern, TVS diodes or Zener diodes could be added to the design to clamp the voltage to a safe level for the DAQ system.

ADC_Interface

Considering the information provided and the standard requirements for a pendulum angle measurement system, a suitable ADC for the DAQ interface can be determined based on typical needs for such applications.

Firstly, the resolution of the ADC should be high enough to capture small changes in the pendulum's angle. A 12-bit ADC is a reasonable choice for this application, providing a fine granularity of measurement (4096 discrete levels for the full voltage range). This should suffice for detailed angle measurement without being excessively precise which would require more complex and costly solutions.

The sampling rate must capture the pendulum's fastest movements. Assuming the pendulum's period is relatively slow (a few swings per second at most), a sampling rate of at least ten times the highest frequency component of the signal should suffice. Thus, a sampling rate of 1 kHz would be more than adequate for most pendulum applications, unless the pendulum swings very rapidly or the application requires capturing very fast transients.

A single-ended ADC input should be sufficient for this application, given that the signal from the potentiometer is referenced to a common ground, and the voltage scaling from the attenuator ensures the signal is within the ADC's input voltage range.

For the communication interface, options such as SPI or I2C are common and easy to interface with most DAQ systems and microcontrollers. SPI is typically faster and might be preferred if the DAQ system will be processing a large amount of data quickly, while I2C is simpler and uses fewer wires.

The linearity of the ADC should be high, with a low integral nonlinearity (INL) and differential nonlinearity (DNL). Generally, an INL and DNL of less than 1 LSB (Least Significant Bit) would be suitable for precision measurements. The input noise level should be low enough not to introduce significant errors in the measurement. An ADC with an Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) close to its resolution would be ideal.

Finally, the ADC's input voltage range should be configurable to match the +/- 7 V range provided by the attenuator stage. This could be achieved by using an ADC with an adjustable reference voltage or by further scaling the signal as needed.

Based on the above considerations, the ADC topology could be summarized as follows:

- Resolution: 12-bit or higher
- Sampling rate: 1 kHz (minimum)
- Input type: Single-ended (assuming common ground with DAQ)
- Communication interface: SPI or I2C
- Linearity: INL and DNL < 1 LSB
- Input noise level: Low, ENOB close to the actual resolution
- Input voltage range: Configurable to match the +/- 7 V range from the attenuator

DIGITAL PROCESSING BLOCK

Based on the inability to answer the specific questions regarding the digital processing block, I will provide general suggestions that can be tailored once the details are clarified:

1. Choose a DAQ system that is compatible with LabVIEW to ensure seamless integration. NI (National Instruments) offers a wide range of DAQ devices with varying resolutions and sampling rates that are designed to work with LabVIEW.

2. When selecting a DAQ, consider the resolution and sampling rate based on the dynamics of the pendulum. For a pendulum, a DAQ with at least 12-bit resolution and a sampling rate that is at least ten times the fastest expected frequency of pendulum oscillation should suffice for accurate angle measurements.

3. Given that the pendulum angle will be monitored in real-time, select a DAQ with low-latency data transfer capabilities. USB, PCI, or Ethernet interfaces are common and supported by LabVIEW, with USB often being the simplest to set up for quick projects.

4. For digital signal processing, a basic software-based filtering algorithm should be implemented within LabVIEW to remove any residual noise. Additionally, a moving average or other smoothing algorithm can be used to stabilize the angle reading if the signal is noisy.

5. Data presentation in LabVIEW can include real-time graphing of the pendulum angle versus time. Consider adding features like zooming and panning for detailed analysis, as well as the ability to log data to a file for post-experiment review.

Once the specifics of the DAQ system and project requirements are known, these suggestions can be refined to design the digital processing block that fulfills the needs of the pendulum angle measurement project.

POTENTIOMETER SELECTION GUIDELINES

Given the absence of specific model information and environmental constraints, here are some general recommendations for the potentiometer that should meet the needs of your pendulum angle measurement project:

- Type: Linear Taper Potentiometer
- Resistance: 10 kOhm
- Rotational Angle: 180 degrees (required to measure the pendulum's full range of motion)
- Power Rating: To be determined based on the maximum voltage applied across the potentiometer and the expected current. A standard 0.25W to 0.5W potentiometer should suffice for signal-level applications.
- Resolution: As high as possible. The resolution of a potentiometer is essentially infinite, but it is limited by the physical properties of the wiper and the resistive track, as well as the quality of the DAQ system's ADC.
- Sensitivity: Dependent on the linearity of the potentiometer. A precision potentiometer with a tight tolerance (e.g., ±1% or better) would provide greater accuracy in angle measurement.
- Durability: A high rotational life rating potentiometer is recommended since the pendulum will be moving frequently. Look for a potentiometer with a rotational life of at least 1 million cycles.
- Environmental Suitability: Without specific temperature and environmental constraints, select a potentiometer that operates within a general commercial range (0°C to 70°C). If the environment is known to have extremes, select an industrial or military-spec component.
- Mechanical Robustness: Choose a potentiometer designed to withstand some mechanical stress, such as those rated for industrial use.
- Size and Mounting: Since there are no size constraints provided, ensure that the selected potentiometer can be easily integrated into the wooden structure and is compatible with the mechanical design.

SUGGESTED POTENTIOMETER:
Bourns 3590 Precision Potentiometer - This model offers a high resolution, is widely available, and has a good lifecycle rating. It is a wirewound potentiometer which provides better accuracy and stability compared to standard carbon track potentiometers.

Note: Make sure to validate the final choice of potentiometer against the actual environmental and mechanical requirements, and consult datasheets for detailed specifications to ensure the potentiometer is compatible with the rest of the system.

Buffer_Amplification_Stage

SOLUTION:
Given the voltage range of -10V to 10V from the potentiometer and the need to filter out 50/60Hz frequencies, the following buffer amplifier characteristics are recommended:

- Topology: A non-inverting op-amp configuration is advisable as it can provide high input impedance, which is necessary to prevent loading the potentiometer and altering its output. This configuration also maintains the phase of the signal, which is important for accurate angle measurement.

- Input Impedance: A high input impedance greater than 1 MΩ is recommended to ensure negligible loading of the potentiometer.

- Gain: The buffer stage should have a unity gain (Gain = 1), as the purpose of this stage is to provide impedance matching and not to amplify the signal.

- Bandwidth/Frequency Response: The buffer should have a bandwidth that accommodates the dynamic range of the pendulum swing. For most pendulum applications, a bandwidth of a few hundred Hertz should be sufficient. However, since we need to filter out 50/60Hz, the buffer's frequency response should be flat up to just below these frequencies and then roll off sharply.

- Power Supply: The power supply for the buffer should be at least ±12V to accommodate the input voltage range of -10V to 10V without clipping. For operational amplifiers with rail-to-rail capability, you may be able to use a slightly lower voltage, but this depends on the specific op-amp chosen.

- Operational Amplifier Selection: Given the lack of specific requirements, a general-purpose precision op-amp is suitable. Low noise characteristics are always beneficial, especially for sensors with low-level signals; however, with a potentiometer swing of -10V to 10V, noise is less of a concern. A rail-to-rail op-amp is not necessary given the sufficient headroom provided by the ±12V (or greater) power supply. For precision, op-amps like the LM324 or TL071 could be used, considering their cost-effectiveness and availability.

The buffer stage does not require any gain-setting resistors due to the unity gain configuration. The op-amp should be chosen based on its input bias current, offset voltage, and drift to ensure stability and accuracy over time and temperature.

Possibilities for the buffer operational amplifier include:
- TL071 (Low noise, JFET input for high impedance)
- LM324 (Quad op-amp, cost-effective, commonly used for buffering)

Both options will provide the required buffering capability, with the TL071 offering better noise performance at a slightly higher cost. The user can select based on the priority of cost vs. noise performance.
