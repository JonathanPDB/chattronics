Score: 3
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance and capacitance are not explicitly mentioned, so we cannot verify if Rf * Cf is around 2/pi with a 10% tolerance.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is given as approximately 125 V/nC, but without the feedback capacitance Cf, we cannot calculate G x 1.61p / Cf to see if it is around 1 with a 10% tolerance.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be 40 pC from the sensor, which does not meet the requirement for it to be around 161 pC.

4. The bias current is not provided explicitly, nor is there any information that would allow us to deduce it.

5. Since the feedback resistance Rf is not given, we cannot verify if 0.01 / Rf equals the bias current.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is in line with the requirements.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, and calculations are provided to back this up.

8. The output voltage from the charge amplifier is designed to be 5 V peak, which does not meet the requirement for the output voltage to be 1 V peak to peak.

9. The op-amp selection mentions a low offset voltage to maintain an offset less than 10 mV, which satisfies the requirement for the offset to be kept below 10 mV.
