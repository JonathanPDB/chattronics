I want to develop a project that calculates the angle of a pendulum by using a potentiometer.
The component will be fixed to a wooden structure and another beam will be connected to the adjustable pin.
The analog output will be sent to a DAQ which cannot be altered or tuned.
Use the simplest design possible, which takes into account all requirements.
