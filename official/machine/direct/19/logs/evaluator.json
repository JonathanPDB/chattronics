Each stage with a gain of 70 using precision op-amps like AD620 or INA118.\n- Power Supply: ±15V for the instrumentation amplifiers.\n\nTemperature Measurement Path:\n- Sensors: Infrared temperature sensors capable of measuring temperatures in the range of -20°C to 500°C. A response time of less than 500 ms and a resolution better than 0.1°C are desirable.\n- Linearization Circuit: A microcontroller-based approach with ADC and lookup tables or polynomial approximation algorithms to linearize the temperature sensor's output.\n- Amplifiers: A non-inverting amplifier topology to amplify the temperature sensor output with a gain of 50, to match the 5V ADC input range.\n\nShared Signal Path:\n- Multiplexer: An 8-to-1 analog multiplexer with a low on-resistance and fast switching capabilities for an ADC sampling rate of at least 1 kSPS per channel.\n- Anti-Aliasing Filter: A 4th-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 350 Hz to prevent aliasing of frequencies above the Nyquist frequency.\n\nADC:\n- Resolution: 16-bit resolution to achieve the 1% accuracy requirement, which corresponds to a resolution of 0.0015% of the full-scale range.\n- Sampling Rate: Minimum of 1 kSPS per channel to capture signals up to 400 Hz according to the Nyquist theorem.\n- Type: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC for a balance between speed, power consumption, and resolution.\n- Input Range: Adjustable or with a PGA to match the conditioned signals from pressure and temperature sensors.\n\nData Interface:\n- Communication Protocol: Universal communication protocol such as USB or Ethernet for compatibility with a broad range of computer systems and networks.\n- Power Supply: Typically 5V or 3.3V DC, in line with common digital circuit requirements.\n\nComponent Selection and Calculation Details:\n1. Pressure Sensor Amplification Calculation:\n   Gain needed = ADC Input Range / Sensor Output Range\n               = 5V / 1mV\n               = 5000\n\n   Assuming two-stage amplification, each stage needs a gain of 70, for a total combined gain of 4900.\n\n2. Temperature Sensor Amplification Calculation:\n   Gain needed = ADC Input Range / Linearized Sensor Output Range\n               = 5V / 100mV\n               = 50\n\n   This can be achieved with a single amplification stage.\n\n3. Anti-Aliasing Filter Design:\n   Order: 4th-order\n   Cutoff Frequency: 350 Hz (slightly below the Nyquist frequency of 400 Hz)\n   Topology: Butterworth for maximally flat passband response\n\nOverall, the system is designed to amplify, filter, and digitize the signals from the pressure and temperature sensors, ensuring signals are accurately captured for analysis by a computer. The design includes provisions for a flexible and robust Data Interface capable of adapting to various user needs and scenarios. All component values and system parameters are chosen based on typical industrial application standards and the project's specifications to ensure compatibility and reliable operation."

      "response": "```explanations\nThe project covers the following requirements:\n\n1. Both sensors have DC output: This is implicit in the description of the sensors, as there's no mention of AC or varying signals requiring demodulation.\n2. Both sensors must be amplified: This is met as the pressure signal is amplified using a dual-stage instrumentation amplifier with a total gain of 4900, and the temperature signal is amplified with a gain of 50.\n3. The pressure sensor must be inserted in a Wheatstone bridge and amplified by an instrumentation amplifier: Although the use of a Wheatstone bridge is not explicitly mentioned, the use of instrumentation amplifiers suggests a bridge configuration might be used. However, due to the lack of explicit confirmation, this requirement cannot be considered as met.\n4. An ADC should be used: This requirement is met as the project includes a 16-bit SAR ADC.\n5. Infrared sensors are being linearized: The project meets this requirement by using a microcontroller-based approach for linearization.\n6. The solution mentions the sampling order strategy: No specific sampling order strategy is mentioned, so this requirement is not met.\n7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is not less than 800 Hz: The sampling rate is stated to be a minimum of 1 kSPS per channel, which exceeds the 800 Hz requirement.\n8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency: The filter is 4th-order Butterworth with a cutoff frequency of 350 Hz. However, the project does not indicate that the gain at half the sampling frequency is at least -20 dB. This requirement is not explicitly met as we cannot determine if the -20 dB attenuation is achieved without additional information.\n9. The low-pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency: The cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter is 350 Hz, which does not meet the requirement of being higher than 400 Hz.\n10. There are low-pass filters before the multiplexer(s): The project includes anti-aliasing filters, but it's not clear whether they are positioned before the multiplexer(s), as required.\n11. The project uses multiplexer(s) to choose channels: This requirement is met with the inclusion of an 8-to-1 analog multiplexer.\n12. The multiplexer(s) are solid state: As the type of multiplexer is not specified, we cannot confirm this requirement is met based solely on the given information.\n\nBased on the information provided, the project summary successfully covers 6 out of the 12 requirements listed.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n6\n```",
