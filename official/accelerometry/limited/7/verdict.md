Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The provided project description outlines a comprehensive design for a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device. However, to assess its compliance with the given requirements, we need to evaluate the details provided:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) of the charge amplifier are given as 620 kΩ and 1000 pF, respectively. The product Rf*Cf = 620 kΩ * 1000 pF = 620 kΩ * 1 nF = 620 ms. This is significantly higher than the required 2/pi (approximately 0.637 ms), and it does not fall within the allowed 10% difference. 

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not explicitly mentioned, so we cannot directly calculate the second requirement (G x 1.61p / Cf) and verify if it is roughly around 1 within a 10% difference.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not specified in terms of pC. The sensitivity of the sensor is given in mV/g, which is after the charge to voltage conversion, so we cannot confirm if the peak-to-peak charge output is around 161 pC.

4. The bias current is not specified, and it's essential to know whether it's provided or not.

5. The bias current relationship to the feedback resistance is not provided. Without this information, we cannot confirm if 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance equals the bias current.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which meets one of the requirements.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, as shown by the cutoff frequency of the filters, but there are no explicit calculations backing up this optimization.

8. The desired output voltage is 1 V peak to peak, which aligns with the requirement.

9. There is a mention of maintaining a low offset voltage of less than 10 mV, which meets the final requirement.

Given that several key requirements are not explicitly met or cannot be verified with the information provided, the project cannot be classified as optimal. Specific crucial parameters such as the charge amplifier gain, peak-to-peak charge output, and bias current details are missing or do not match the required criteria, which are essential for the functionality of the charge amplifier circuit.
