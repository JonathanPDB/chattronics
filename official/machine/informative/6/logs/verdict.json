Both sensors have d.c. output, so no demodulation should be used. (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n2. Both sensors must be amplified (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n3. The pressure sensor must be inserted in a wheatstone bridge and amplified by a instrumentation amplifier\n4. An ADC should be used (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n5. Infrared radiation sensors are being linearized either digitally in the computer or by using diode networks or log amplifiers. (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n6. The solution mentions the sampling order strategy, if it'll be sequential, simultaneously, etc\n7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is not less than 800 Hz (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency\n9. The low pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency.\n10. There are low-pass filters (or anti-aliasing filters) to reduce aliasing, which are positioned before the multiplexer(s)\n11. The project uses multiplexer(s) to choose channels (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n12. The multiplexer(s) are solid state\n\nYou will categorize the summary into 1 of 5 categories:\n\"optimal\" - use this if the all requirements were reached\n\"acceptable\" - use this category if the project can be implemented and doesn't have any fatal issues, but the score isn't perfect.\n\"generic\" - use this category if the project is theoretically correct and can be implemented, but too generic to have real value.\n\"unfeasible\" - use this if the project is theoretically correct, but contains elements that makes it impossible to implement\n\"incorrect\" - the information provided is conceptually wrong\n\nRequirements marked as essential must be fulfilled in order for a good verdict.\nYou must think as a project designer if the solution is applicable and well thought out.\n\nYou will provide explanations regarding your verdict, the explanations must explicitly indicate which requirements were not reached.\nYou always follow the exact following template in markdown blocks, where all caps words are placeholders for you to fill in.\nInside the verdict placeholder, you will provide only the chosen category.\n\n\n```explanations\nEXPLANATIONS HERE\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nVERDICT_CATEGORY\n```\n\n"

        "content": "Comprehensive Design Overview for Pressure and Temperature Monitoring System\n\nPressure Sensor Array:\n- Sensor Type: Industrial-grade strain-gauge pressure sensors (e.g., Honeywell Model 31 series or similar).\n- Pressure Range: Broad range, common is 0-100 psi (specific range to be defined based on application).\n- Accuracy: At least 1% of full scale.\n- Environmental Sealing: Appropriate IP rating for protection against moisture and dust, EMI shielding.\n\nAmplifier_Pressure:\n- Gain: With a 1 mV full-scale output from the pressure sensor and a 5V ADC input range, the required gain is calculated as 5000 (G = 5V / 1mV).\n- Topology: Instrumentation amplifier recommended for its precision, low offset, and low drift (e.g., AD620, INA118).\n\nFilter_Pressure:\n- Topology: Active low-pass filter with a Sallen-Key or Multiple Feedback (MFB) configuration.\n- Order: 4th order Butterworth filter to provide a flat frequency response up to 400 Hz.\n- Cutoff Frequency: Set at approximately 500 Hz to ensure a flat response up to 400 Hz without significant attenuation.\n\nTemperature Sensor Array:\n- Sensor Type: Non-contact infrared temperature sensors (e.g., MLX90614 by Melexis) with a standard range of -70°C to +380°C.\n- Accuracy: ±0.5°C around room temperatures and a resolution of 0.02°C.\n- Field of View: Appropriate for the monitored surface area.\n\nAmplifier_Temperature:\n- Gain: Assuming a maximum sensor output of 100 mV and a 5V ADC range, a gain of 50 is calculated (G = 5V / 100mV).\n- Topology: Fixed Gain Precision Amplifier or Programmable Gain Amplifier based on the need for flexibility.\n\nFilter_Temperature:\n- Topology: Active low-pass filter with a Butterworth response for a maximally flat passband.\n- Order: 2nd order is suggested for balancing complexity and performance.\n- Cutoff Frequency: A standard starting point around 1 Hz since temperature changes are slow.\n\nMultiplexer:\n- Type: High-Speed 16:1 Analog Multiplexer capable of switching speeds much faster than 800 Hz.\n- Control Signals: Compatibility with standard logic levels (3.3V or 5V).\n\nADC:\n- Sampling Rate: Minimum overall sampling rate of 12.8 kHz is needed for sequential sampling of 16 channels at 800 Hz each.\n- Resolution: At least 12 bits, but 16 bits is recommended for greater accuracy.\n- Topology: Successive-approximation register (SAR) ADC or sigma-delta ADC for higher resolution and filtering capabilities.\n\nComputer:\n- Processing: Scalable, flexible computing system capable of buffering incoming data, processing, and storage.\n- Communication: Standard interfaces such as USB, SPI, I2C, or Ethernet should be supported.\n- Software: Modular programming approach, cross-platform libraries, real-time monitoring, and visualization capabilities.\n- Environmental Considerations: Industrial-grade components for a wide temperature range, humidity and EMI protection.\n\nPlease note that the exact component selection, numerical values for filter components, and further system specifics will need to be validated and adjusted based on detailed project requirements and real-world performance assessments."

However, since both sensors are described as having a d.c. output, it can be inferred that demodulation is not part of the design, fulfilling requirement 1.\n\nAmplification is mentioned for both the pressure and temperature sensors, satisfying requirement 2.\n\nThe pressure sensor is described to be amplified by an instrumentation amplifier, which is in line with requirement 3.\n\nAn ADC with a sampling rate of 12.8 kHz is specified, which exceeds the minimum 800 Hz per channel, satisfying requirement 4 and 7.\n\nLinearization of infrared radiation sensors is not explicitly mentioned, so requirement 5 cannot be confirmed to be met.\n\nThe summary does not detail the sampling order strategy (sequential or simultaneous), which does not fulfill requirement 6.\n\nThe anti-aliasing filter is described with a cutoff frequency of approximately 500 Hz for the pressure sensor and around 1 Hz for the temperature sensor, but it does not specifically address the requirement of having at least -20 dB gain at half the sampling frequency, leaving requirement 8 unverified.\n\nThe low-pass cutoff frequency is stated to be set at 500 Hz for the pressure sensor, which is higher than 400 Hz but not explicitly less than half the total sampling frequency, which is required to determine if requirement 9 is met.\n\nRequirement 10 is addressed with the inclusion of low-pass filters, but their position relative to the multiplexer(s) is not explicitly stated.\n\nMultiplexers are mentioned in the design, satisfying requirement 11, and they are described as solid state, which meets requirement 12.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
