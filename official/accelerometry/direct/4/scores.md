Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and capacitance (Cf) are given as 64 MΩ and 10.1 pF, respectively. The Rf x Cf product is 64e6 * 10.1e-12 = 646.4e-6 ≈ 0.6464. The desired product is 2/pi ≈ 0.6366, and the difference is approximately 1.5%, which is within the 10% allowed difference.
2. The gain (Av) is given as 155.3 V/C. Using the provided formula G x 1.61e-12 / Cf, we get 155.3 V/C * 1.61e-12 C / 10.1e-12 F = 1.61 / 10.1 ≈ 0.159. This is not close to 1, even considering a 10% difference.
3. The accelerometer sensitivity is 100 pC/g, and the expected peak acceleration is 0.0201 g, which would result in a peak charge of 100 pC/g * 0.0201 g = 2.01 pC. This is much less than the required 161 pC, possibly due to a misinterpretation of the expected peak acceleration or an error in the sensitivity value. 
4. There is no explicit mention of how the bias current is provided.
5. The relationship between the bias current and feedback resistance is given as 0.01 / Rf = bias current. With Rf being 64 MΩ, the bias current would be 0.01 / 64e6 A = 156.25e-12 A (156.25 pA), but without a specific value for the bias current, this requirement cannot be fully verified.
6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as described in the architecture overview.
7. The accelerometer and charge amplifier design are based on a 2 Hz input oscillation and 5 cm amplitude, with calculations provided for the expected peak acceleration.
8. There is no clear statement indicating the output voltage is 1 V peak to peak.
9. There is no mention of the offset voltage, except for the selection of op-amps with low offset voltage, which does not confirm the offset is kept below 10 mV.
