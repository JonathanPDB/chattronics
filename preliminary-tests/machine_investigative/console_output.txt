Pressure Sensor Array (x8): This block represents an array of eight strain-gauge pressure sensors that convert the physical pressure applied on the sensors to an electrical signal, with a maximum output of 1 mV. The sensors' output is proportional to the pressure applied, and they have an accuracy of 1%.

Temperature Sensor Array (x8): This block consists of eight infrared radiation detectors used to measure surface temperature. These sensors detect the infrared energy emitted by the object and convert it into an electrical signal, with a maximum output of 100 mV and an accuracy of 1%.

Pressure Signal Conditioning: This block conditions the small signals from the pressure sensors. It involves amplification to boost the signal levels from millivolts to a more usable voltage range, filtering to remove noise and interference, and potentially offset adjustments to compensate for sensor inaccuracies.

Temperature Signal Conditioning: This block performs similar functions to the pressure signal conditioning block but is tailored for the infrared temperature sensors. It may include amplification, filtering, and linearization to ensure that the temperature readings are accurate and suitable for digitization.

8-to-1 Multiplexer: This block selects one of the eight inputs from either the pressure or temperature signal conditioning blocks at a time, allowing them to share a single ADC. This is necessary to reduce the number of ADCs required for the system.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC): This block converts the analog signals coming from the multiplexer into digital signals that can be read and processed by a computer. The ADC must have enough resolution and sampling rate to capture the full scale and dynamics of the conditioned signals.

Data Interface to Computer: This block provides a communication interface between the ADC and the computer. It formats the digital data into a protocol and a format that is suitable for analysis by the computer software. This could be a standard interface like USB, Ethernet, or a specialized data acquisition interface.

Pressure Sensor Array

Type of Sensor: Strain-gauge pressure sensor
Pressure Range: Since the specific pressure range is not provided, a common industrial range of 0 to 100 psi is assumed, which can be adjusted based on further clarification. However, the sensor selection should favor a model that offers variants in different pressure ranges so it can be tailored to the exact needs of the application.
Operating Temperature Range: As the exact operating temperature range is not specified, we will assume a typical industrial range of -40°C to 85°C, ensuring that the sensors can operate effectively in a wide range of machine environments.
Safety Ratings: Without specific information, it is prudent to select sensors that have a standard level of protection against dust and moisture, such as an IP65 rating. If the sensors are to be used in a potentially explosive atmosphere, ATEX or IECEx certified sensors should be considered.
Power Supply Requirements: Strain-gauge sensors typically operate on a low voltage DC supply, often in the range of 5 V to 10 V. They are usually designed with a Wheatstone bridge circuit that requires a constant voltage supply with minimal ripple. The current consumption is generally low, typically less than 10 mA per sensor.
Accuracy: The sensors will be selected with an accuracy of 1% Full Scale (FS) to meet the project's accuracy requirements.
Sensitivity and Resolution: Sensitivity will be determined by the output voltage at the maximum pressure range. For an output of 1 mV at the maximum range, the sensitivity should be 1 mV/psi if a 0 to 100 psi range is considered. The resolution of the sensor should be well below the accuracy requirement (1% FS), which means the resolution should be at least 0.01% FS.
Suggested Model: A generic suggestion would be the Honeywell Sensing and Productivity Solutions S Series, which offers a variety of pressure ranges and has built-in temperature compensation. A specific model in this series would be selected to match the assumed pressure range and output requirements, such as the SSC Series.

Note: The selections above are based on reasonable assumptions and common practices in industrial applications. Once specific requirements such as actual pressure range, operating conditions, and power supply specifics are determined, the sensor specification should be revisited for optimization.

Temperature Sensor Array

Since the specific details for the infrared radiation detectors are not provided, I will suggest a suitable sensor and define the requirements based on typical applications and standard performance for industrial monitoring systems.

Suggested Sensor: MLX90614
- The MLX90614 from Melexis is a popular choice for non-contact infrared temperature sensing. It offers a digital output, which simplifies integration with microcontrollers and ADCs.

Temperature Range:
- The MLX90614 has variants that can measure temperatures from -70°C to +380°C, which should cover most industrial applications.

Response Time and Thermal Resolution:
- Response Time: Approximately 10 ms to 100 ms, depending on the configuration.
- Thermal Resolution: 0.02°C (20 mK) at room temperature, which provides fine-grained temperature changes.

Environmental Durability:
- The MLX90614 is designed for harsh environments and has a sealed package that resists ambient environmental challenges like dust and humidity.

Field of View and Measurement Distance:
- The sensor typically has a 90-degree field of view. The ideal measurement distance for the MLX90614 is between 5 cm and 1 m, depending on the specific variant and lens configuration.

Output Voltage and Accuracy:
- Output: The MLX90614 provides a PWM or I2C digital output, which avoids the need for further signal conditioning for voltage level shifting.
- Accuracy: Generally ±0.5°C around room temperatures.

Based on these parameters, the user can ensure that the data acquisition system's ADC has the necessary resolution to capture the smallest temperature increments and that the system's design considers the sensor's response time and field of view. If these specs do not match the application requirements, further adjustments or sensor selections might be necessary.

Note: If the surface temperature range or environmental conditions are different from the above assumptions, then an alternative sensor model with specifications matching the project requirements should be selected.

PRESSURE SIGNAL CONDITIONING BLOCK

- Since the required output voltage range for the ADC is not specified, a common ADC input range is assumed to be 0 to 5 V.
- The excitation voltage for strain gauges is typically between 1 V and 10 V. Without specific requirements, a mid-range excitation of 5 V is assumed.
- With the interest in frequencies up to 400 Hz, a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency slightly higher than 400 Hz should be used to avoid aliasing and to attenuate unwanted higher-frequency components.
- The absence of a specified maximum tolerable latency implies that a standard response time is acceptable. The response time of the signal conditioning circuitry will largely depend on the filter design.
- Power supply voltages are not specified, so standard industrial supply voltages of ±15 V or +5 V for single supply operation are assumed. Power consumption constraints are not provided, so the design will prioritize signal integrity and accuracy over power efficiency.

Given the above assumptions, the following topology suggestions and parameter values are proposed:

1. Instrumentation Amplifier (IA):
   - Gain: To amplify a 1 mV maximum output to at least 0 to 5 V, a gain of at least 5000 is needed (5000 * 1mV = 5V).
   - Input: Connections to the strain gauge using a Wheatstone bridge configuration for full-bridge, half-bridge, or quarter-bridge, depending on the specific sensor design.
   - Power Supply: ±15 V for dual supply or +5 V for a rail-to-rail single supply instrumentation amplifier.

2. Low-Pass Filter (LPF):
   - Type: Active Butterworth for smooth roll-off without ripple in the passband.
   - Order: 4th order (two stages) for sufficient attenuation of frequencies above 400 Hz.
   - Cutoff Frequency: 500 Hz to allow the signal of interest to pass while filtering out higher frequencies.
   - Components: Operational amplifiers with resistors and capacitors calculated to achieve the desired cutoff frequency.

3. Excitation Voltage Source:
   - Voltage: 5 V stable reference voltage source for strain gauge excitation.
   - Configuration: Connect to the strain gauge bridge in a manner appropriate for the chosen bridge configuration.

4. Voltage Reference (for single supply IA):
   - Voltage: 2.5 V to provide a mid-supply reference point, creating a virtual ground at half the supply voltage.

Example component values for a 4th order LPF (two 2nd order stages in cascade) with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz, assuming a standard supply voltage of ±15 V:

- Operational Amplifiers: Any precision op-amp with a GBW product of at least 2 MHz (e.g., LM324, TL074).
- Resistors (R1, R2, R3, R4 for each stage): aiming for near-equal resistor values for simplicity, choose 10 kΩ.
- Capacitors (C1, C2 for each stage): Use the formula 1 / (2 * π * R * f_c) to calculate the capacitor value. With R = 10 kΩ and f_c = 500 Hz, C ≈ 31.8 nF. Choose standard value 33 nF.
- The precise values of R and C may need to be adjusted based on the available standard component values and to fine-tune the filter's cutoff frequency.

Note: The actual component values and circuit configurations may need to be further refined based on detailed specifications of the sensors, power supply, and ADC characteristics, as well as the layout and construction of the physical circuit. Additionally, the final design should be validated through simulation and/or prototyping to ensure it meets the performance requirements.

TEMPERATURE SIGNAL CONDITIONING

Given the constraints and information provided, the signal conditioning block for the infrared radiation temperature sensors can be designed with the following topology and parameters:

TOPOLOGY:
1. Buffer Amplifier: A high-input impedance, unity-gain buffer amplifier can be used to prevent loading of the sensor signal. This will ensure that the maximum voltage output of 100 mV from the sensor is not dropped across the input resistance of the signal conditioning circuit.

2. Low-Pass Filter: Since the exact noise characteristics are not specified, a low-pass filter with a reasonable cutoff frequency can be used to minimize high-frequency noise. A simple RC low-pass filter can be implemented if the environment does not have significant electromagnetic interference. If more stringent noise filtering is necessary, an active low-pass filter design may be employed.

3. Isolation (Optional): If the environment or application suggests potential common-mode noise or if there is a need to break ground loops, optical or magnetic isolation can be included in the signal path.

PARAMETERS:
1. Buffer Amplifier: No gain is required since the ADC can handle the maximum output of 100 mV. The buffer should have high input impedance (greater than 1 MΩ).

2. Low-Pass Filter:
   - Cutoff Frequency (f_c): Without specific dynamic requirements, a conservative cutoff frequency can be chosen that is high enough to pass the signal of interest but low enough to attenuate possible noise. Assuming the temperature changes are not extremely rapid, a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz to 100 Hz could be appropriate.
   - Component Values: For an RC filter, R and C values can be chosen such that f_c = 1/(2πRC). For example, with f_c = 50 Hz, R = 3.2 kΩ and C = 1 µF could be chosen.

3. Isolation (Optional): If isolation is implemented, the isolation component should support the full signal range and have a bandwidth that accommodates the signal frequency and any filtering requirements.

IMPLEMENTATION SUGGESTIONS:
- Use precision components to maintain the accuracy of 1% as specified for the temperature sensors.
- Provide proper shielding and grounding to minimize noise pickup.
- If the environment is electrically noisy, consider using an active filter and/or shielded twisted-pair cables for sensor wiring.
- Ensure that the ADC input impedance is high compared to the output impedance of the signal conditioning block to avoid signal attenuation.

8-TO-1 MULTIPLEXER

- The multiplexer's input channels should support a range from 1 mV to 100 mV to accommodate both the pressure and temperature sensor outputs.
- The required bandwidth for the multiplexer is at least 800 Hz to ensure no significant distortion or attenuation of the measured signals, which have a frequency of interest up to 400 Hz.
- Sequential sampling is sufficient for the application, which means the multiplexer can channel the sensor outputs to the ADC one at a time, in a round-robin fashion.
- Since specifics about switching time and crosstalk are not provided, a general guidance is to choose a multiplexer with a fast switching time to minimize the dead time between channel switching. The switching time should be significantly less than the period of the highest frequency of interest (400 Hz, or 2.5 ms) to minimize errors due to channel transition. Crosstalk should be minimized to prevent interference between channels, so a multiplexer with good channel isolation is preferred.
- For the control interface of the multiplexer, a standard serial communication protocol such as SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) or I2C could be used, depending on the ADC interface. The choice will also be influenced by factors like the ease of implementation, system speed requirements, and the number of control lines available. If the space permits and for ease of maintenance, integrating the multiplexer on the same PCB as the signal conditioning circuits is often preferred. However, if the sensors are located far from the signal conditioning circuits or if there are isolation requirements, then a separate module might be necessary.

Suggested Implementation:
- Choose a high-precision analog multiplexer such as the DG408 or ADG1606, which support a wide voltage range and have low on-resistance and low crosstalk.
- The multiplexer should have a switching time well below 2.5 ms. A typical high-speed multiplexer can have switching times in the nanoseconds to microseconds range, which is appropriate.
- The multiplexer can be controlled using an SPI interface for simplicity and speed, provided the ADC also supports this protocol. Otherwise, match the multiplexer control interface with that of the ADC.
- Design the PCB with proper ground planes and shielding techniques to minimize noise pickup and crosstalk.
- Ensure that the power supply for the multiplexer is clean and stable to avoid introducing errors in the measurement due to power supply noise.

ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC)

Given the lack of specific information on the requirements such as resolution, sampling rate, communication interface, power supply, and environmental considerations, we would have to make reasonable assumptions and suggest an ADC that is likely to meet the general needs of this pressure and temperature monitoring system.

In general, the ADC should have a high enough resolution to accurately represent the small signal levels from the sensors, especially the 1 mV maximum output from the pressure sensors. Assuming that the accuracy of 1% is for the full-scale output, a resolution of at least 10 bits would be needed, as this provides a quantization step size of 0.1%. However, to ensure even better precision and to account for noise and other error sources, a higher resolution is recommended. 16-bit resolution is a commonly used standard that provides a good balance between precision and cost.

For the sampling rate, it depends on the dynamics of the machine being monitored. Without specific information, a conservative approach would be to assume that the temperature and pressure changes are relatively slow, and a sampling rate of at least twice the highest frequency of interest, according to the Nyquist theorem, would suffice. For most industrial applications, a sampling rate of a few hundred Hertz to a few kilohertz is usually sufficient.

For the communication interface, without specific requirements, a versatile interface such as SPI or I2C is recommended. These are widely supported, allow for easy integration with most computer systems, and provide sufficient data transfer rates for the expected data volumes.

The power supply requirements are not specified, but most ADCs can operate within a range of 3.3V to 5V, which are standard logic levels. Power consumption typically isn't a critical issue unless the system is battery-powered or has strict thermal limitations.

In the absence of environmental constraints, a standard commercial-grade ADC should suffice. However, if the system operates in harsh environments, an industrial-grade ADC with extended temperature ranges and robust packaging may be necessary.

Considering these factors, a suggested ADC specification could be as follows:

- Resolution: 16-bit
- Sampling Rate: 1 kHz (minimum)
- Communication Interface: SPI/I2C (user-selectable, if possible)
- Power Supply: 3.3V to 5V
- Operating Temperature: -40°C to 85°C (industrial grade)

A specific ADC that meets these criteria might be the ADS1115, which is a 16-bit ADC with a programmable gain amplifier (useful for amplifying the 1 mV pressure sensor signal), an internal oscillator, and an I2C interface. However, for a multiplexed system with eight channels for both temperature and pressure, a simultaneous-sampling ADC or a system with multiple ADCs might be more suitable to avoid phase delay between channels.

Note: These are general recommendations, and the specific choice of ADC may vary based on additional application-specific requirements and constraints.

DATA INTERFACE TO COMPUTER

Without specific details on the preferred interface, communication protocol, data rate requirements, real-time data streaming needs, operating environment, and compliance standards, the design for the 'Data Interface to Computer' block will have to be based on general best practices and common industry standards.

Given the absence of specific requirements, the following generalized approach can be taken:

- Interface Selection: A universal interface like USB can be considered due to its commonality in computer systems, ease of use, and sufficient data transfer rates for most sensor data. For longer distances or networked sensors, Ethernet could be a more appropriate choice.

- Communication Protocol: Standard communication protocols, such as USB HID (Human Interface Device) for USB or TCP/IP for Ethernet, should be used to ensure compatibility with a wide range of computer systems and ease of software integration.

- Data Rate: The data rate should be chosen to accommodate the highest expected sampling rate from the ADC, multiplied by the resolution and the number of sensors. An overhead should be considered for protocol encapsulation.

- Real-Time Data Streaming: If real-time monitoring is essential, the interface should allow for continuous data streaming with minimal latency. Otherwise, a buffering mechanism might be introduced to store and transfer data in batches.

- Robustness: For industrial environments, additional protective measures should be taken, such as opto-isolation, to safeguard against electrical noise and potential damage to the computer interface.

- Compliance: It should be designed to be compliant with general standards such as CE and FCC to ensure it meets basic safety and electromagnetic interference (EMI) requirements.

In the absence of specific answers, designing a flexible and robust data interface system that adheres to industry standards and can be easily adapted to a range of different computer systems and applications is recommended.
