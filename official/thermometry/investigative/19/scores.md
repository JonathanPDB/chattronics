Score: 5
Explanations: 
1. The output is measured by a multimeter: The summary implies that the output voltage is readable by a multimeter, but does not explicitly state this.

2. Amplification stage with gain provided and justified: The gain is calculated and justified based on the assumed voltage range from the thermistor (100mV) and the desired output range (0-20V), resulting in a gain of 200.

3. Output voltage range is between 0 and 20 Volts: The gain is set to amplify the signal to a 0-20V output range, fulfilling this requirement.

4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC: There is no explicit mention of a linearization resistor or method, only that calibration may be required.

5. The NTC is linearized: This requirement is not explicitly met in the summary, as no specific linearization technique is mentioned.

6. Architecture: The project summary outlines the architecture consisting of the sensor, constant current source, amplification, and mentions optional filtering. This meets the requirement.

7. The sensor used is an NTC: The Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC Thermistor is specified, satisfying this requirement.

8. The self-heating effect is considered, and maximum current through the NTC is known: The design uses a 100 µA current to minimize self-heating, fulfilling this requirement.
