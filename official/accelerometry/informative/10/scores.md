Explanations: 
1. The product of feedback resistance (Rf = 2.7 MΩ) and feedback capacitance (Cf = 220 pF) needs to be roughly 2/π. The calculated value is 2.7e6 * 220e-12 = 0.594e-3. The expected value is 2/π = 0.6366e-3. The given value is approximately 6.7% less than the expected value, which is within the 10% allowed difference. This requirement is met.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (G) is given as 2 V/nC (or 2e9 V/C). Multiplying the gain by 1.61e-12 and dividing by Cf (220 pF = 220e-12 F) gives (2e9 * 1.61e-12) / 220e-12 = 1.61 / 0.22 ≈ 7.32, which is not close to 1. This requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not provided directly in the summary. However, the sensor sensitivity is 100 pC/g, and the measurement range is ±5 cm peak vibration amplitude. Without information about the acceleration or force applied, we cannot determine the peak-to-peak charge output. This requirement is not met.

4. The bias voltage is provided as being less than 10 mV. However, the bias current is not explicitly mentioned. The bias current is not the same as the bias voltage and cannot be inferred from the provided information. This requirement is not met.

5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (Rf) must equal the bias current cannot be verified without the value of the bias current. Since the bias current is not provided, this requirement is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the signal from a piezoelectric sensor. This requirement is met.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and has calculations to back it up, as seen in the low-pass filter section with a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz. However, there are no explicit calculations provided for the 5 cm amplitude. Only the measurement range is given. This requirement is partially met but not fully verifiable without additional information.

8. The charge amplifier gain calculation indicates an output voltage of 1 V peak to peak for a charge of 500 pC. This requirement is met.

9. The bias voltage is specified to be less than 10 mV, which can be assumed to be the offset voltage. Since it is below 10 mV, this requirement is met.
