Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary indicates a system designed to measure the angle of a pendulum using a potentiometer and various signal conditioning stages before digital acquisition. The following points address the requirements:

1. The potentiometer is appropriately used as a voltage divider.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the required +/- 10 V.
3. The architecture is simple and consists of a voltage divider, an anti-aliasing filter, and the DAQ system.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, with a maximum input voltage of +/- 7V, which matches the requirement.
5. The differential amplifier with a gain of 7/10 and the non-inverting amplifier with a gain of approximately 1.4 are designed to ensure the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ does not exceed 7V.
6. The anti-aliasing filter is a second-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 150 Hz, which should help avoid aliasing given the DAQ's sampling rate of 1000 samples per second.
7. The band-stop filters for 50 Hz and 60 Hz are designed to remove power line noise, satisfying the requirement for a filter to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz.
8. The cutoff frequency and order of the anti-aliasing filter are not directly specified to achieve -20 dB at 500 Hz, but a second-order filter with a 150 Hz cutoff typically would not provide -20 dB attenuation at 500 Hz. It would likely be closer to -12 dB, depending on the filter design.

While most requirements are met, the project does not explicitly ensure that the anti-aliasing filter provides at least -20 dB gain at 500 Hz, which is a critical requirement. Therefore, the project is not optimal. However, with minor adjustments to the filter design to ensure proper attenuation at 500 Hz, the project could be acceptable. As it stands, the project is theoretically correct but lacks specific implementation details to fully satisfy all requirements.
