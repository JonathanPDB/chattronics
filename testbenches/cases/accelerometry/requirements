1. The feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance must be equal to around 0.636
2. The amplifier gain times 1.61 times the feedback capacitance should be around 1
3. The bias current must be provided
4. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current
5. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor
6. The project is optimised for an input oscillation of 2Hz and 5cm amplitude and has calculations to back it up.
7. The output voltage is 1V peak to peak
8. The offset is less than 10mV
