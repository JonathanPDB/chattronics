Analog Water Temperature Measurement System

This summary presents an analog-based solution for measuring the temperature of water using a thermistor and outputting a voltage readable by a multimeter.

Thermistor Sensor (NTCLE100E3):
- Type: NTC Thermistor, Vishay NTCLE100E3 series.
- Nominal Resistance at 25°C (R25): 10kΩ (typical for NTC thermistors).
- Beta Value (B value): 3950K (typical for the NTCLE100E3 series).

Linearization Circuit:
- Objective: To linearize the thermistor's response around 50°C.
- Linearization resistor (R_LIN): Estimated at 5kΩ to match the expected thermistor resistance at 50°C, assuming a typical NTC behavior.

Buffer (Voltage Follower):
- Operational Amplifier: Selected for high input impedance. Example: LM324 or TL081.
- Power Supply: Assuming a single-ended supply of 24V.
- Configuration: Unity-gain buffer without additional components, unless stability issues arise.

Amplification Stage:
- Gain: 10 (to convert a 2V span into a 20V span).
- Operational Amplifier: OPAx177 or similar precision amplifier with rail-to-rail output.
- Power Supply: 24V single supply.
- Resistors for Gain Setting: R1 = 10kΩ (feedback), R2 = 1kΩ (ground to inverting input).
- Offset Adjustment: 10kΩ potentiometer for calibrating the exact full-scale voltage.

Voltage Offset:
- Objective: Adjust output voltage range to match 0-20V for the multimeter.
- Operational Amplifier: AD712, LT1013, or OPA2277 for precision offsetting.
- Voltage Divider: Precision resistors, R1 = R2 = 10kΩ, 0.1% tolerance, for setting non-inverting input voltage.
- Offset Adjustment: 10kΩ multi-turn precision potentiometer for calibration.

Output Stage (0-20V):
- Operational Amplifier: Analog Devices AD8628ARZ or similar rail-to-rail op-amp.
- Protection Diodes: 1N5819 Schottky diodes for reverse polarity protection.
- Overvoltage Protection: 1N4747A 20V Zener diode with a 1 kΩ series resistor.
- Output Capacitance: 10-100nF ceramic capacitor for noise filtering (if required).

Multimeter:
- A precision multimeter capable of measuring voltages in the 0-20V range, such as Fluke 287 or Fluke 289.
- Must have high input impedance (at least 10 MΩ), good resolution (10 mV or better), and accuracy (±0.1% or better).

Measurement Approach:
- Calibrate the multimeter against a known voltage reference.
- Connect the multimeter to the output stage.
- Allow the thermistor to stabilize temperature with the water.
- Set the multimeter to DC voltage measurement.
- Read the voltage and convert it to temperature based on the established transfer function.
- Recalibrate periodically for accuracy.

Note: The proposed component values and configurations are based on general assumptions and should be fine-tuned with actual thermistor specifications and multimeter characteristics. The described system provides a starting point which requires careful calibration and potentially additional refinement to achieve the desired measurement accuracy and range.
