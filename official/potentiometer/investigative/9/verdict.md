Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The design summary presents a pendulum angle measurement system that incorporates the required elements such as a potentiometer, a buffer amplifier, an anti-aliasing filter, a voltage divider, and a DAQ system. Here's how the design aligns with the provided requirements:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V.
3. The architecture is simple and includes the mentioned components.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0 V, which aligns with the requirement for a +/- 7V range.
5. The design does not explicitly state that the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V, but it's implied by the configuration of the voltage divider.
6. There is a low pass filter to avoid aliasing, with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz.
7. The filter's attenuation at 50/60 Hz is not explicitly confirmed to be greater than the required -20 dB, which could be a potential issue.
8. The filter has a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz, but the order is not specified, and the attenuation at 500 Hz is not confirmed to be at least -20 dB.

The summary does not provide explicit confirmation for requirements 7 and 8 regarding the filter's performance at 50/60 Hz and at 500 Hz. The attenuation levels at these frequencies are critical for the project's success. Without this data, it's uncertain whether the filter meets the required specifications. However, the project can be implemented, and the issues identified are not fatal, as they can be addressed with proper filter design adjustments.
