Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System includes several key components that align well with the specified requirements. The use of a potentiometer as a voltage divider and the application of a +/- 10 V power supply are clear and meet the requirements. The presence of a voltage buffer (Buffer Amplifier) is a good practice to ensure the potentiometer's output is not loaded down, and the anti-aliasing filter is correctly included to avoid aliasing. Additionally, the notch filter is present to remove unwanted 50 and 60 Hz frequencies. 

However, there are a few concerns:
1. The scaling amplifier has a calculated gain of 1.4, which should scale a +/- 10 V signal to fit within the +/- 7 V range. But the potentiometer will not always reach the full +/- 10 V swing, which means the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ might occasionally be less than 7V, but should not exceed it, fulfilling the requirement.
2. The anti-aliasing filter's cutoff frequency is set at 400 Hz, which is lower than the 500 Hz mentioned in the requirements. This design decision seems conservative and should not cause a problem, but it is different from the specified 500 Hz.
3. The requirement that the filter has a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz is not explicitly confirmed by the provided specifications, but given the 4th-order Butterworth filter with a 400 Hz cutoff frequency, this requirement is likely to be met.

Given these points, the architecture is simple and includes all necessary components: a voltage divider (with a voltage buffer), an anti-aliasing filter, and a DAQ system with the correct input voltage range. The gain of the signal at 500 Hz is not explicitly mentioned, but the design of a 4th-order Butterworth filter with a 400 Hz cutoff would typically meet the -20 dB gain requirement at 500 Hz. Overall, the design is theoretically sound and should be implementable without fatal issues.
