The sampling rate of the DAQ is 1000 samples per second.\n6. Frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz should be attenuated.\n7. The conditioning should be done in the analog domain\n8. The DAQ is only for acquisition, you can not alter its configuration.\n9. The maximum accepted input voltage for the DAQ is +/- 7 V"
