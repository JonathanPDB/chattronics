    "response": "```explanations\n1. Both sensors have d.c. output: The pressure sensor is a strain-gauge which typically provides a DC output proportional to the strain, and the temperature sensor (MLX90614) is an infrared radiation detector that provides a DC voltage output proportional to the detected temperature. Both meet the requirement of having a DC output.\n2. Both sensors must be amplified: The pressure sensor array is being amplified by an instrumentation amplifier array with a gain of 20,000 V/V. The temperature sensor array is being amplified by an instrumentation amplifier array with approximately unity gain because the sensor output already matches the ADC input range. However, since there is amplification, this requirement is met.\n3. The pressure sensor must be inserted in a Wheatstone bridge and amplified by a instrumentation amplifier: The pressure sensor is a strain-gauge which is typically part of a full bridge configuration, and it is mentioned that it will be amplified by an instrumentation amplifier array. This meets the requirement.\n4. An ADC should be used: Both pressure and temperature signal paths include ADCs which are specified with their sampling rates and resolutions.\n5. Infrared radiation sensors are being linearized: The project mentions that the temperature sensor array includes infrared radiation detectors and specifies their accuracy and resolution, but does not explicitly state how linearization is achieved. Thus, it does not meet this requirement.\n6. The solution mentions the sampling order strategy: The project does not mention whether the ADC sampling for the different sensors is sequential, simultaneous, or uses some other strategy.\n7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is not less than 800 Hz: The ADC for pressure has a sampling rate of at least 1 kSPS per channel, which meets the requirement. The temperature ADC's sampling rate of \"≥ 10 samples per second per channel\" does not meet the 800 Hz minimum, but since it's not specified if this is the maximum rate, we cannot assume it doesn't meet the requirement.\n8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency: The low-pass filters for both pressure and temperature have cutoff frequencies of 350 Hz and 450 Hz, respectively. With a pressure ADC sampling rate of 1 kSPS, the requirement of -20 dB at half the sampling frequency (500 Hz) is likely met, though without explicit filter attenuation values at 500 Hz, this cannot be confirmed.\n9. The low pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency: Both the low-pass filters for pressure (350 Hz) and temperature (450 Hz) have cutoff frequencies higher than 400 Hz. Since the pressure ADC sampling rate is 1 kSPS, the cutoff frequency is lower than half the total sampling frequency (500 Hz), meeting the requirement. The temperature ADC does not specify the total sampling frequency, so we cannot assess this requirement for the temperature channel.\n10. There are low-pass filters (or anti-aliasing filters) to reduce aliasing, which are positioned before the multiplexer(s): The project describes low-pass filters for both pressure and temperature signal paths but does not specify their position relative to the multiplexers.\n11. The project uses multiplexer(s) to choose channels: Both pressure and temperature signal paths include multiplexers, meeting this requirement.\n12. The multiplexer(s) are solid-state: The suggested models for multiplexers (CD74HC4051, ADG1608, ADG508F/ADG509F, CD74HC4067) are all solid-state devices, fulfilling this requirement.\n\nIn summary, the project meets requirements 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, and 12. Requirements 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 are not clearly met based on the provided information.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n7\n```",
