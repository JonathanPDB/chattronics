Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a detailed description of an analog electronics design for measuring the angle of a pendulum. However, there are several points that need to be addressed to determine if it meets the requirements:

1. The potentiometer is appropriately used as a voltage divider.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the +/- 10V range.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, a buffer stage, a level shifter, an amplification block, a notch filter, and an anti-aliasing filter before the DAQ measures the voltage, which fits the required simple architecture.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at +/- 7V, which matches the requirement.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V, which is within the specified limit.
6. An anti-aliasing filter is included in the design, which helps to avoid aliasing as required.
7. A notch filter is designed to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, fulfilling the requirement for filtering these specific frequencies.
8. The anti-aliasing filter is a second-order active low-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of approximately 150 Hz. The requirement specifies a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, and the summary mentions -40 dB or more at the Nyquist frequency. If we assume the Nyquist frequency is at least twice the cutoff frequency (which is a standard practice), then the attenuation at 500 Hz would likely meet the -20 dB requirement. However, the exact attenuation at 500 Hz is not explicitly provided, which makes it difficult to confirm.

The project summary seems to fulfill most of the requirements, but the precise attenuation at 500 Hz is not specified, which leaves some uncertainty regarding whether the requirement for the filter's performance at that frequency is met. It is also important to note that while the anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency of approximately 150 Hz, the actual order of the filter is not specified, which may affect the attenuation level at 500 Hz. Overall, the project appears to be well thought out, but there is a need for clarification on the filter's performance at 500 Hz to ensure it meets the -20 dB gain requirement.
