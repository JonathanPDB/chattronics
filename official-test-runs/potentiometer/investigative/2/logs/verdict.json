    "response": "```explanations\nThe design of the pendulum angle measurement system mostly aligns with the requirements provided. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, and the voltage applied to it is within the +/- 10 V range. A voltage follower is utilized to prevent loading the potentiometer, which is crucial for maintaining signal integrity. An anti-aliasing filter is present in the form of a low pass filter with a 10 Hz cutoff frequency, which should prevent aliasing given the slow motion of a pendulum. Additionally, a notch filter is integrated to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which effectively tackles power line noise.\n\nHowever, there are some aspects that need clarification or adjustment:\n\n1. The cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter is presumed to be 10 Hz. It is essential to confirm that this cutoff frequency is sufficient to avoid aliasing for the highest frequency component expected from the pendulum's motion. If the pendulum can oscillate faster than expected, the cutoff frequency might need to be adjusted.\n\n2. The notch filter is specified with a notch depth of -20 to -40 dB, which generally meets the requirement of having a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz. However, the summary does not explicitly state the filter's cutoff frequency and order. These parameters should be defined to ensure that the requirement is met.\n\n3. The attenuation ratio is calculated correctly to prevent the DAQ from receiving more than 7V. The resistors are chosen to match the attenuation ratio, which should ensure that the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ does not exceed 7V, fulfilling this critical requirement.\n\n4. The DAQ system is specified with a 1000 samples per second sampling rate and a resolution of at least 12-bit, which should be adequate for capturing the pendulum's motion without introducing quantization errors. However, the summary does not explicitly mention whether the input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0V, as required.\n\nGiven these considerations, the design appears to be well thought out with no fatal flaws, but it requires minor clarifications to ensure all requirements are met. The project can be implemented with some adjustments and is therefore categorized as \"acceptable.\"\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
