The potentiometer is linear\n2. The value of the potentiometer is 10 kOhms\n3. The power source connected to the potentiometer is between -10 and 10 Volts\n4. The angle range that the potentiometer should be able to measure is from 45 to 135 degrees, in which 90 degrees corresponds to the steady position\n5. The sampling rate of the DAQ is 1000 samples per second.\n6. Frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz should be attenuated.\n7. The conditioning should be done in the analog domain\n8. The DAQ is only for acquisition, you can not alter its configuration.\n9. The maximum accepted input voltage for the DAQ is +/- 7 V"
