Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project design for a low-frequency vibration measurement device using a piezoelectric sensor and charge amplifier has several key requirements to consider:

1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and feedback capacitance (C_f) product should be around 2/pi (with up to 10% tolerance). In this design, R_f = 8 MΩ and C_f = 200 pF, so R_f * C_f = 1.6 s. The target value for this product should be 2/pi ≈ 0.637 s, which is significantly lower than the designed product. This requirement is not met as the difference exceeds the allowed 10% tolerance.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (G) is not explicitly provided, but it can be inferred from the conversion of peak charge output (100 pC at 1 g acceleration) to a 0.5 V peak voltage. However, without explicit values for G, it is not possible to verify whether the condition G x 1.61p / C_f ≈ 1 (with up to 10% tolerance) is met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC, which aligns with the requirement if the accelerometer is subjected to 1.61 g. However, the resolution and sensitivity provided do not indicate that the device is optimized for the required output.

4. The bias current is not explicitly mentioned, nor is its provision detailed.

5. The relationship 0.01 / R_f = bias current is not addressed in the provided information. Without the bias current value, this requirement cannot be verified.

6. The project does utilize a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is in line with the requirements.

7. The project is designed with a low-frequency cutoff of 0.1 Hz, which would not affect signals up to 2 Hz. However, it does not explicitly mention optimization for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, nor does it provide calculations to back this up.

8. The output voltage is not specified to be 1 V peak to peak; instead, a 0.5 V peak voltage at 1 g acceleration is mentioned, which does not meet the requirement.

9. There is no mention of an offset voltage or how it is kept below 10 mV, which is an essential requirement.

Overall, there are key requirements that are not met or not addressed sufficiently in the project description. Specifically, requirements 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are either not met or not clearly verified through the provided information. This leads to the conclusion that the project, as described, would not be feasible without significant adjustments and additional information.
