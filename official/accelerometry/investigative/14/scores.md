Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) of the charge amplifier are given as 200 kΩ and 82 nF, respectively. Multiplying these values gives us (200,000 Ω * 82e-9 F) = 0.0164 seconds. This value is not within 10% of 2/pi (approximately 0.637), so this requirement is not met.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (G) is given as 0.2 mV/pC, which is 0.2e-3 V/pC. Multiplying this by 1.61e-12 and dividing by the feedback capacitance (Cf) of 82 nF gives us (0.2e-3 * 1.61e-12 / 82e-9) = 3.92e-6, which is not roughly around 1, so this requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly mentioned, but the maximum expected charge Q_max of 5000 pC is given. Since this does not pertain to the peak-to-peak charge output of 161 pC, requirement 3 is not met.

4. There is no mention of bias current being provided in the design summary, so requirement 4 is not met.

5. The bias current and its relationship to the feedback resistance is not mentioned, so requirement 5 is not met.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as mentioned in the design summary. This requirement is met.

7. The project is optimized for a low-frequency response with a 3 dB point at 0.25 Hz, which is not the same as being optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz. Also, there are no calculations provided to back it up for 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude. Therefore, requirement 7 is not met.

8. The desired output voltage of the charge amplifier is 1 V peak to peak, which meets requirement 8.

9. There is no mention of the offset voltage, so requirement 9 is not met.
