Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary describes a pendulum angle measurement system with various components including a potentiometer, attenuator, notch filter, anti-alias filter, buffer, and a data acquisition system (DAQ). Here's how it aligns with the given requirements:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, which aligns with the requirement.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V, which is within the specified range.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, buffer, anti-alias filter, and DAQ, which is in line with the requirement.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, with a range of +/- 7 V as required.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V, which meets the essential requirement.
6. There is an anti-aliasing filter present, with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz, which should help avoid aliasing.
7. A notch filter is present to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz.
8. The anti-alias filter is a second-order Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter with a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz. The requirement specifies a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz. A second-order filter has a roll-off of -12 dB/octave, which may not be sufficient to achieve -20 dB at 500 Hz given the cutoff frequency of 400 Hz.

The design appears to meet most requirements, but there might be a concern with the anti-alias filter's ability to sufficiently attenuate the signal by -20 dB at 500 Hz due to its cutoff frequency and order. This should be verified with simulation or calculation to ensure that requirement 8 is met. If the filter does not meet the -20 dB at 500 Hz requirement, this would need to be addressed for the design to be considered optimal.
