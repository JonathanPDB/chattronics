Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The design summary presents a system for pressure and temperature monitoring using analog sensors, amplification, multiplexing, filtering, and digital conversion. The requirements are addressed as follows:

1. Both sensors have DC outputs, as specified by their max output signals, and no demodulation is mentioned, fulfilling requirement 1.
2. Amplification is recommended for both sensors with gains of 1000x for the pressure sensor and 10x for the temperature sensor, meeting requirement 2.
3. The pressure sensor is amplified using instrumentation amplifiers, but it is not explicitly stated that it is inserted in a Wheatstone bridge, which is a concern for requirement 3.
4. An ADC with a sampling rate of at least 12.8 ksamples/s aggregate is used, which satisfies requirement 4.
5. The project does not explicitly state the method of linearization for the infrared radiation sensors, which is a critical omission for requirement 5.
6. The sampling order strategy is not explicitly mentioned, which leaves requirement 6 unaddressed.
7. The minimum sampling rate of 800 Hz per channel is met, as the system has an aggregate sampling rate of 12.8 ksamples/s for 16 channels, meeting requirement 7.
8. The anti-aliasing filter's cutoff frequency is 500 Hz, and the order is specified, but the gain at half the sampling frequency is not detailed, making it difficult to assess requirement 8.
9. The low-pass cutoff frequency is 500 Hz, which is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency, satisfying requirement 9.
10. Low-pass filters are mentioned, but their position relative to the multiplexer is not specified, leading to uncertainty regarding requirement 10.
11. The use of a 16-to-1 analog multiplexer is confirmed, fulfilling requirement 11.
12. The multiplexer models specified are solid state, meeting requirement 12.

Several requirements are met; however, there are critical omissions regarding the Wheatstone bridge configuration for the pressure sensor, the linearization method for the infrared sensors, the sampling order strategy, the detailed specifications of the anti-aliasing filter, and the positioning of the low-pass filters. Due to these omissions, the project cannot be classified as "optimal."
