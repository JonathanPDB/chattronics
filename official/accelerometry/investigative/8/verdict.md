Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The charge amplifier's design is critical in ensuring accurate signal conditioning for low-frequency vibration measurement. Let's evaluate the charge amplifier design based on the provided information:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) product should be approximately 2/pi. Given Rf = 300 MÎ© and Cf = 1 nF, the product Rf * Cf = 300e6 * 1e-9 = 0.3 s. The desired product according to the 2/pi requirement is approximately 0.637 s. The actual product is significantly off, not within the 10% allowance.

2. The gain (G) of the charge amplifier is 10 V/nC. The requirement specifies that G * 1.61p / Cf should be roughly around 1. Substituting the values, we get 10 * 1.61e-12 / 1e-9 = 1.61e-2, which is not close to 1, and outside the 10% allowance.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be 161 pC, which meets the requirement.

4. and 5. The bias current should be provided, and it should equal 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance. The bias current is not explicitly mentioned, so this requirement is not verifiable with the given information.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is in line with the requirements.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude and appears to have calculations to back it up, although the detailed calculations are not provided.

8. The output voltage is stated to be 1 V peak to peak, which aligns with the requirement.

9. The offset should be kept below 10 mV, but there is no information provided about the offset voltage, making it impossible to evaluate this requirement.

Given the discrepancies in the feedback resistor-capacitor product and the gain calculation, the design does not meet the essential requirements concerning the charge amplifier. However, since most of the other requirements are met or are not explicitly contradicted by the information provided, the project seems to be on the right track but needs adjustments to meet the specified criteria.
