Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design for the pendulum angle measurement system is reviewed based on the provided requirements. The use of a linear rotary potentiometer as a voltage divider is in line with the first requirement. Although the voltage applied to the potentiometer is not explicitly mentioned, the DAQ's input voltage range is specified as bipolar, at least +/- 7 V, which suggests that the potentiometer's voltage should be compatible. 

The architecture includes a voltage divider, buffer amplifier, scaling amplifier, anti-aliasing filter, notch filter, and the DAQ, which meets the simplicity requirement. The buffer amplifier and scaling amplifier appear to be designed to ensure the DAQ's input voltage is centered at 0 and does not exceed +/- 7 V. 

The anti-aliasing filter is specified with a first-order and second-order cutoff frequency of 50 Hz. However, the requirement states that the gain of the signal must be at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, which may not be achieved with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz and a filter order of 1 or 2. A higher-order filter may be necessary to ensure that the gain is sufficiently reduced by 500 Hz to meet the -20 dB requirement.

There is a notch filter included to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which meets the seventh requirement.

In conclusion, the design appears to meet most requirements, but there is a potential issue with the anti-aliasing filter's ability to achieve the required attenuation by 500 Hz. If the anti-aliasing filter cannot provide at least -20 dB gain at 500 Hz, this could be a fatal flaw. However, without explicit evidence that the filter fails this requirement, the design can be considered acceptable with the recommendation to verify and adjust the anti-aliasing filter design to ensure compliance with the -20 dB gain specification at 500 Hz.
