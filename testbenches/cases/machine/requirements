1. Both sensors have d.c. output, so no demodulation should be used. (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
2. Both sensors must be amplified (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
3. The pressure sensor must be inserted in a wheatstone bridge and amplified by a instrumentation amplifier
4. An ADC should be used (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
5. Infrared radiation sensors are being linearized either digitally in the computer or by using diode networks or log amplifiers. (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
6. The solution mentions the sampling order strategy, if it'll be sequential, simultaneously, etc
7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is not less than 800 Hz (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency
9. The low pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency.
10. There are low-pass filters (or anti-aliasing filters) to reduce aliasing, which are positioned before the multiplexer(s)
11. The project uses multiplexer(s) to choose channels (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
12. The multiplexer(s) are solid state
