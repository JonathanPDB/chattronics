Design of a Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Sensor:
- A piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g.
- Assumed environmental operating conditions: temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C.
- Assumed power supply for the sensor: 3.3 V or 5 V for portability.
- Resolution: Assuming a minimum detectable change of 0.001 g.

Charge Amplifier:
- Feedback capacitor (C_f) value of 200 pF to convert the peak charge output (100 pC at 1 g acceleration) to a 0.5 V peak voltage.
- Feedback resistor (R_f) value of approximately 8 MΩ to set the amplifier's low-frequency cutoff to 0.1 Hz and avoid affecting the signal of interest (up to 2 Hz).
- Inverting amplifier topology with sensor connected to the inverting input.
- Assumed operating conditions: standard commercial temperature range and noise level.

Low Pass Filter:
- Second-order active Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz.
- No passband ripple, as it is a characteristic of the Butterworth filter design.
- Assumed component values would be calculated based on the chosen op-amp specifications.

Buffer:
- Unity gain buffer (voltage follower) to isolate the load effects of the subsequent stages.
- Assumed load impedance: 10kΩ.
- Assumed power supply: single supply of 5V or dual supply of ±5V to ±15V.
- Standard op-amps suggested include LM358 for single supply or TL072 for dual supply applications.

Additional Considerations:
- Calibration of the device using a shaker table with known vibration parameters.
- Oscilloscope such as the Tektronix TBS1000 or Rigol DS1054Z for observing the output signal and ensuring proper filtering.
- Precision low-noise rail-to-rail operational amplifiers for charge amplifier and buffering stages, such as the Analog Devices AD8605 or Texas Instruments OPAx2336.
- Ensure proper grounding and shielding of the circuit to minimize noise interference.
