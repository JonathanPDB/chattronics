Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The potentiometer is correctly used as a voltage divider and the voltage applied to it is within the specified +/- 10 V range. The buffer is included, which is good practice to prevent loading of the potentiometer. However, the power supply for the op-amp is not specified to be bipolar, which could be an issue since the potentiometer output will be bipolar and the buffer needs to accommodate this.

The anti-aliasing filter design is generally described well, with considerations for the cutoff frequency, order, and topology. However, the suggestion of a 150 Hz cutoff frequency might not be sufficient to ensure a -20 dB attenuation at 500 Hz, depending on the order of the filter and the filter type's characteristics. More detailed calculations or specifications are needed to determine if the requirement for attenuation at 500 Hz is met.

Additionally, the summary does not mention a specific filter design for removing frequencies around 50 to 60 Hz, which is a requirement. This could be a notch filter or a band-stop filter, and its absence is a significant oversight.

The ADC specifications are adequate, with a suitable resolution and sampling rate. The input voltage range is also appropriate, but it is not clear if the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ will be limited to 7V, which is a critical requirement.

Overall, the design is well thought out but lacks some specifics and has a couple of oversights that need to be addressed to meet all the requirements.
