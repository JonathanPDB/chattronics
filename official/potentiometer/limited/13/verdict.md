Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System seems thoughtful and well outlined, with several aspects that align with the requirements:

1. The potentiometer is indeed used as a voltage divider and is capable of handling the specified voltage range of +/- 10V, which is a requirement.

2. The design includes an offset adjustment, which is essential to ensure that the input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0V. However, the summary does not explicitly confirm that the output voltage swing of the system is within the specified +/- 7V range.

3. An amplifier is used to scale the potentiometer's output to the DAQ's input range, with a gain of 1.4. This should theoretically keep the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ at 7V, but it depends on the initial voltage swing from the potentiometer, which is not specified. If the potentiometer's output is indeed Â±5V for the extreme angles, then the requirement is met.

4. The low-pass filter design with a cutoff frequency at 250 Hz may not be sufficient to meet the requirement of at least -20 dB gain at 500 Hz. A 2nd order Butterworth filter has a roll-off rate of -12 dB/octave. The filter needs to attenuate signals to meet the -20 dB specification at 500 Hz, which suggests the cutoff frequency should be lower or a higher-order filter should be used.

5. The inclusion of notch filters for 50 Hz and 60 Hz is appropriate to remove frequencies around power line interference, which is a requirement.

6. The anti-aliasing filter is a 2nd order active low-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz, which should help prevent aliasing. However, the summary does not indicate whether this filter ensures that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz.

7. The DAQ system meets the specifications of a 12-bit resolution and a sampling rate of 1000 samples per second.

While the project seems well thought out and potentially feasible, there are uncertainties and potential issues that need to be addressed to ensure that all requirements are fully met. Specifically, the details on how the maximum DAQ input voltage is assured to be limited to 7V and the effectiveness of the filtering to meet the -20 dB gain at 500 Hz requirement are not clearly stated.
