Both sensors must be amplified (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n3. The pressure sensor must be inserted in a wheatstone bridge and amplified by a instrumentation amplifier\n4. An ADC should be used (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n5.

    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary provides a comprehensive design for an analog instrumentation system for pressure and temperature monitoring. However, it does not explicitly address all of the requirements listed. Here is a breakdown of how the project aligns with the requirements:\n\n1. Both sensors have d.c. output - The project summary does not explicitly state that both sensors have a d.c. output, which is a fatal flaw if false.\n2. Both sensors must be amplified - The project includes amplifier arrays for both pressure and temperature sensors, fulfilling this requirement.\n3. Wheatstone bridge and instrumentation amplifier for the pressure sensor - The project mentions using an instrumentation amplifier but does not specify the use of a Wheatstone bridge.\n4. Use of an ADC - The project includes an ADC with a sampling rate of at least 2 kHz, meeting this requirement.\n5. Infrared radiation sensors linearization - The project mentions analog computing linearization and diode linearization for temperature sensors, which satisfies this requirement.\n6. Sampling order strategy - The project summary does not mention the sampling order strategy, which is necessary for a complete design.\n7. ADC sampling frequency - The ADC has a sampling rate of at least 2 kHz, which is above the required 800 Hz.\n8. Anti-aliasing filter's gain at half the sampling frequency - The project specifies a stopband attenuation of 60 dB by 800 Hz, which satisfies the requirement of at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency.\n9. Low-pass filter cutoff frequency - The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency of 450 Hz, which is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency (given that the sampling frequency is at least 2 kHz).\n10. Low-pass filters before the multiplexer - The project includes anti-aliasing filters, but it is not clear whether they are positioned before the multiplexer, as required.\n11. Use of multiplexers - The project includes multiplexers with specifications that suggest they are used to choose channels, fulfilling this requirement.\n12. Multiplexers are solid state - The suggested models, such as the ADG1606 and ADG1408, are solid-state multiplexers.\n\nOverall, the project fails to explicitly confirm the use of d.c. output for both sensors and does not detail the sampling order strategy or the positioning of the anti-aliasing filters in relation to the multiplexer. Additionally, the use of a Wheatstone bridge for the pressure sensor is not specified. These shortcomings are critical to the project's alignment with the stated requirements.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nunfeasible\n```",
