1. Use a piezoelectric accelerometer
2. The accelerometer has a sensitivity of 100 pC/g
3. An input oscillation has a frequency of 2Hz
4. The input oscillation has an amplification of 5cm.
5. Output voltage should be 1 V peak to peak
6. Low frequency response is 3 dB down at 0.25 Hz
7. The offset should be kept as less than 10mv
8. The minimum value of the feedback resistance should be calculated
9. The maximum amplifier bias current is should be calculated
10. The feedback capacitance in the charge amplifier should be calculated
