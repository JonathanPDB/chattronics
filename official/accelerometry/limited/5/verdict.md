Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project summary describes a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device centered around a piezoelectric accelerometer and a charge amplifier. To assess the project, we will examine the provided information in light of the required specifications:

1. The feedback resistance (R_f) is 68 MΩ and the feedback capacitance (C_f) is 10 pF. The product R_f * C_f = 68e6 * 10e-12 = 680e-6. The desired value is roughly 2/π, which is approximately 0.637e-6. The actual product is more than 1000 times larger than the desired value, which is far beyond the allowed 10% difference.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not explicitly provided, so we can't directly evaluate the second requirement (G x 1.61p / C_f). However, since the feedback components are already incorrect, it is likely that this requirement is also not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output specification is not directly addressed in the project summary, so we cannot confirm whether the output is around 161 pC.

4. The bias current must be provided, but the summary does not mention it explicitly.

5. If we were to calculate the bias current using the given feedback resistance (0.01 / R_f), we would get a value of approximately 147 nA (0.01 / 68e6). However, this is not confirmed in the summary as the bias current that the project is actually using.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which aligns with the requirement.

7. The summary mentions a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.25 Hz, which does not match the optimization for an input oscillation of 2 Hz. This could lead to signal attenuation at the frequency of interest.

8. The output voltage is specified to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets the requirement.

9. The offset voltage is not specified; therefore, we cannot confirm if it is kept below 10 mV.

Given these points, the project does not meet several essential requirements, particularly the correct feedback components for the charge amplifier and the bias current provision.
