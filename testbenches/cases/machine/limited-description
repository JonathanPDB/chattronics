Design a system to monitor pressure and surface temperature variations at eight points of a machine and the data is to be analysed by computer.
Design the acquisition system but don't worry about any software implementations or logic analysis.

1. The accuracy of both sensors should be at of 1%
2. The pressure sensors have a maximum output of 1 mV
3. Temperature sensors are radiation detectors having a maximum output of 100 mV
4. Temperature sensors have a nonlinear scale
5. Strain-gauge should be used as the pressure sensor
6. Infrared radiation detectors should be used for the surface temperature sensor.
7. Assume all pressure sensors have identical sensitivity
8. Signal frequencies up to 400 Hz are expected
9. Frequencies higher than 400 Hz (if present) need not be recorded.
10. The ADC should sample one channel at a time
