Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a detailed approach to designing an analog instrumentation system for machine monitoring that covers a range of requirements. However, there are certain gaps and ambiguities that need to be addressed:

1. The pressure sensors have a DC output, and there is no mention of demodulation, meeting requirement 1.
2. Both sensors are amplified, as indicated by the use of instrumentation amplifiers for pressure sensors and nonlinear amplifiers for temperature sensors, satisfying requirement 2.
3. While instrumentation amplifiers are mentioned for pressure sensors, there is no explicit mention of their integration within a Wheatstone bridge configuration, which is critical to meet requirement 3.
4. An ADC is included with a specified sampling rate, fulfilling requirement 4.
5. The summary indicates the use of linearization mechanisms for temperature sensors, but it is not clear if this is achieved through digital methods, diode networks, or log amplifiers, leaving requirement 5 ambiguous.
6. The summary does not specify the sampling order strategy (sequential, simultaneous, etc.), failing to address requirement 6.
7. The ADC's sampling rate is specified to be at least 1 kHz per channel, which satisfies the minimum 800 Hz sampling frequency as per requirement 7.
8. There is no information provided about the anti-aliasing filter's attenuation at half the sampling frequency, leaving requirement 8 unaddressed.
9. The low-pass filters for both pressure and temperature have cutoff frequencies above 400 Hz, but there is no mention of them being lower than half the total sampling frequency, which is necessary to meet requirement 9.
10. The presence of low-pass filters before the multiplexer(s) is indicated, which helps in reducing aliasing, meeting requirement 10.
11. A 16-to-1 analog multiplexer is included in the design, which satisfies requirement 11.
12. The specified multiplexers (ADG1606 or DG406) are solid-state devices, in line with requirement 12.

Overall, the project summary does not fully meet all the essential requirements, particularly with regards to the Wheatstone bridge configuration for pressure sensors, the explicit linearization methods for temperature sensors, the sampling order strategy, and the specifications of the anti-aliasing filters. Therefore, the project cannot be categorized as "optimal".

Given that the project can potentially be implemented with adjustments and clarifications to meet the requirements, and considering that there are no fatal issues per se, but rather ambiguities and omissions, the verdict for this project would be "acceptable".
