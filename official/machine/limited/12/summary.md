Design of an Analog Instrumentation System for Pressure and Temperature Monitoring

Pressure Sensor Input:
- Sensors: Strain-gauge pressure sensors with an industrial range of 0 to 10 bar.
- Sensitivity: 1 mV/V/bar with a 10 V excitation voltage, outputting 0-10 mV over the range.
- Environmental Conditions: Sensors with an IP65 rating or higher, operating within a -40°C to 85°C temperature range.
- Suggested Model: Honeywell Trustability High-Accuracy Silicon Ceramic (HSC) Series.

Amplifier_Pressure:
- Amplification: Instrumentation amplifiers with a gain of 1000 to scale the 0-10 mV signal to a 0-5V ADC input range.
- Bandwidth: The amplifier bandwidth should exceed 400 Hz.
- Suggested Operational Amplifiers: Analog Devices AD620 or Texas Instruments INA333.

Filter_Pressure:
- Type: Active low-pass Butterworth filter.
- Order: Second-order to provide a 12 dB/octave roll-off rate.
- Cutoff Frequency: 800 Hz to remove unwanted high-frequency noise.
- Components: Resistors R = 3.9 kΩ and capacitors C = 1.02 nF for each stage.

Mux_Pressure:
- Topology: 8-channel analog multiplexer/demultiplexer such as CD74HC4067 with SPI or parallel control interface.
- Operating Temperature Range: Industrial grade, typically -40°C to +85°C.

Temp_Input:
- Temperature Range: Assumed -20°C to 500°C.
- Resolution: 0.1°C at the sensor output.
- Suggested Sensor Type: IR thermopile sensor, such as the Melexis MLX90614.

Amplifier_Temp:
- Topology: Non-inverting amplifier topology for initial amplification followed by a linearization circuit.
- Gain: Approximately 50 (for 0-100 mV output to 0-5V ADC input range).
- Components: Precision operational amplifier like the AD8605, R = 10 kΩ, C = 330 nF.

Filter_Temp:
- Type: Active low-pass Butterworth filter.
- Order: 2nd-order with a cutoff frequency of 450 Hz.
- Components: Resistors R1, R2 = 1 kΩ, Capacitors C1, C2 = 330 nF.

MUX:
- Configuration: Two 8-to-1 multiplexers for pressure and temperature (e.g., CD4051B), and one 2-to-1 multiplexer (e.g., DG202) for final stage.
- Control Interface: SPI for compatibility and ease of interfacing.
- Voltage Levels: Compatible with microcontroller/ADC logic levels, typically 3.3V or 5V.

ADC:
- Type: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC.
- Resolution: 12-bit to maintain 1% accuracy and account for signal noise.
- Sampling Rate: 20 kSPS total, considering 1 kHz per channel for 16 channels (8 pressure + 8 temperature).
- Input Voltage Range: 0-5V or 0-10V, depending on the gain used in signal conditioning.
- Communication Interface: SPI or I2C, depending on system design.

DSP:
- Sampling Rate: 1 kHz per channel.
- Digital Interface Protocol: USB or Ethernet, based on data rate and system compatibility.
- Data Rate: 96 kbps for 8 channels at 12-bit precision and 1 kHz sampling rate.
- Data Format: Standard numerical representation (integer or floating-point).
- Real-Time Processing Tasks: Digital low-pass filtering with a cutoff frequency slightly above 400 Hz, and other tasks like peak detection or data compression as needed.
