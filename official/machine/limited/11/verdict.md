Verdict: incorrect

Explanations: 
The project summary presents a detailed design for a pressure and temperature monitoring system. However, some critical requirements specified for the project review are not met:

1. The temperature sensor specified (MLX90614ESF-BAA) has a digital output, which violates the requirement for both sensors to have a DC output without the need for demodulation.
2. The summary does not explicitly state that both sensors are amplified, though gain stages and instrumentation amplifiers are mentioned, it is not clear that these are directly connected to the sensors.
3. The pressure sensor is intended to be amplified by an instrumentation amplifier, which aligns with the requirements.
4. An ADC is used with a sampling rate of at least 1 kHz per channel, which satisfies the requirement.
5. Linearization for the infrared radiation sensor is mentioned, indicating the use of a logarithmic amplifier.
6. The summary does not mention the sampling order strategy (sequential, simultaneous, etc.).
7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is at least 1 kHz per channel, exceeding the minimum requirement of 800 Hz.
8. The anti-aliasing filter is specified with a cutoff frequency of 450 Hz, but there is no information about the filter's gain at half the sampling frequency.
9. The low-pass filter's cutoff frequency is within the required range.
10. Low-pass filters are mentioned, but their positioning relative to the multiplexer is not specified.
11. Multiplexers are used in the design.
12. The multiplexers specified are solid state.

Considering the above points, the project fails to meet several key requirements, most notably the requirement for both sensors to have a DC output and the absence of explicit mention for the amplification of both sensors. Additionally, the sampling order strategy is not discussed, and the anti-aliasing filter's performance at half the sampling frequency is not specified.
