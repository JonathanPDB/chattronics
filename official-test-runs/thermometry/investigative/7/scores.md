Score: 7
Explanations: 
The project summary covers the following requirements:

1. The output is being measured by a multimeter: Although not explicitly stated, it is implied that the multimeter will be used to measure the output voltage, as the system is designed to output a voltage in the range that a multimeter typically measures.

2. There is an amplification stage with the gain provided and justified: The project summary specifies the use of an operational amplifier to amplify the voltage signal to the 0-20V range. The gain calculation is provided with an example of how to set the gain to approximately 1.25, justifying it with the estimated voltage output at temperature extremes.

3. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is between 0 and 20 Volts: The amplification stage is designed to ensure the voltage output is within this range.

4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC: The text mentions that a fixed resistor is chosen to match the NTC at the midpoint of the temperature range, which implies that the system is designed for linearization at 50 ºC.

5. The NTC is linearized: The process of linearization is mentioned, even though detailed calculations for the linearization are not provided.

6. The architecture consists of the sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering, and measurement: The project summary describes a system that includes all these components.

7. The sensor used is an NTC thermistor: The type and model of the NTC thermistor are specified.

8. The self-heating effect is taken into account: The project summary does not mention the self-heating effect or the maximum current that passes through the NTC. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

Overall, the project summary meets 7 out of the 8 requirements. The only requirement not met is the consideration of the self-heating effect of the NTC thermistor.
