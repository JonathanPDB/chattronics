Analog Instrumentation for Water Temperature Measurement with Thermistor and Voltage Output

Thermistor Sensor Block:
- Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor (assumed typical values: 10kΩ at 25°C, beta ≈ 3950K)
- Temperature range: 10°C to 90°C
- Sensitivity and Resolution: Assuming 0.1°C or better

Linearization Resistor Block:
- Linearization Resistor: 5kΩ to 10kΩ (to be refined with actual thermistor data)

Buffer Op-Amp Block:
- Voltage follower configuration using an operational amplifier (e.g., TL071)
- Power supply voltage for the op-amp: 24V DC (single supply) assumed for headroom

Instrumentation Amplifier Block:
- Voltage range: 0 to 20V output
- Gain calculation: Assuming Vin_max ≈ 1V for the thermistor, the gain required, Av = 20V / 1V = 20
- Suggested IC: Analog Devices AD620 with gain settable via external resistor
- CMRR and PSRR: Above 80 dB (typical specification for AD620 or similar)

Anti-Aliasing Filter Block:
- Second-order active low-pass filter using Sallen-Key topology
- Component values for a 10Hz cutoff frequency: C1 = C2 = 1uF, R1 = R2 = 15.92kΩ
- Butterworth response with a damping ratio (ζ) of 0.7071 for a maximally flat passband

Output Stage Block:
- Buffer Amplifier: Operational amplifier in a voltage follower configuration
- Feedback Resistor: 10kΩ for stability
- Power Supply: Shared with the Instrumentation Amplifier if necessary (e.g., ±12V)

Note: The provided solution is based on common assumptions for general-purpose applications, using standard component values, and typical operational characteristics. Exact component values, part numbers, and specifications should be verified and potentially adjusted based on the specific thermistor being used and the actual operating conditions of the circuit. Calibration and precise adjustments would be necessary to ensure accuracy and optimal performance in the final implementation.
