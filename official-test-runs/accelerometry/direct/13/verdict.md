Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project is designed to measure low-frequency vibrations and includes a piezoelectric accelerometer, a charge amplifier, filters, an additional amplifier stage, and an ADC. However, there are discrepancies and missing information regarding the requirements:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and capacitance (Cf) product does not satisfy the requirement. Rf * Cf = 10 MÎ© * 1 nF = 10 seconds, which is far from the required 2/pi (~0.637) seconds. This value is not within the 10% tolerance of the requirement.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not explicitly stated, but an additional gain stage with a gain of approximately 12.66 is mentioned. Without knowing the gain of the charge amplifier, it is impossible to verify if the condition G x 1.61p / Cf is roughly around 1 within a 10% tolerance.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output of the accelerometer at peak acceleration is specified as 79 pC, which does not match the requirement of 161 pC.

4. The bias current is specified by the operational amplifier AD8628, but it is not stated explicitly. Therefore, it is unclear if it meets the requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current.

5. The project is designed for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, but there is no explicit statement or calculation provided to demonstrate the optimization for this input.

6. The output voltage requirement of 1 V peak to peak is mentioned to be achieved with an additional gain stage and a gain of 100 on the amplifier. However, without the charge amplifier gain, it is not possible to confirm if this requirement is met.

7. There is no information provided about the offset voltage, which should be kept below 10 mV as per the requirements.

Based on the information provided, the project does not meet several of the essential requirements, and therefore, it cannot be categorized as optimal or acceptable. The feedback resistance and capacitance product is significantly off the required value, the charge output does not match the requirement, and there is insufficient information about the gain, bias current, and offset voltage. Thus, the project cannot be implemented as described.
