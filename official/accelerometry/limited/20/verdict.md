Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a comprehensive design for a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device, including a piezoelectric accelerometer and charge amplifier. However, there are issues with the design that need to be addressed to meet the set requirements:

1. The feedback resistance (R_f) of 4.7 MΩ and feedback capacitance (C_f) of 150 pF results in a time constant (τ = R_f * C_f) of 705 microseconds. The required time constant to meet the first requirement is τ = 2/π ≈ 0.637 microseconds, allowing for a 10% difference. The calculated time constant in the design is significantly higher than the required value, thus not meeting the first requirement.

2. The charge amplifier gain (G) of 10^4 V/C multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (150 pF) results in G x 1.61p / C_f = 107.33, which is far from the required value of approximately 1, with an allowable 10% difference. This does not meet the second requirement.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the accelerometer sensitivity of 100 pC/g and the maximum expected acceleration of 1g, the expected peak-to-peak charge output would be 100 pC, which is lower than the required 161 pC.

4. The bias current is not provided in the summary, which is essential to determine if requirement 5 is met, as it dictates the relationship between the bias current and feedback resistance.

5. Without the bias current value, it is impossible to verify if 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance equals the bias current, thus requirement 5 is not verifiably met.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the signal from a piezoelectric sensor, which aligns with requirement 6.

7. The design is optimized for a low-pass filter with a 0.25 Hz cutoff, which does not align with the requirement of being optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz. This suggests the calculations may not support the required optimization, thus not meeting requirement 7.

8. The output voltage is expected to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets requirement 8.

9. The offset voltage is not discussed, so it is unclear if it is kept below 10 mV, as required by requirement 9.

The design summary, while detailed, does not meet several essential requirements, particularly in terms of the charge amplifier's feedback resistance and capacitance, the gain calculation, and the bias current relationship. Additionally, the optimization for a 2 Hz input oscillation is not apparent in the provided cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter.
