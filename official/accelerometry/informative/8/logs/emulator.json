The sensitivity is 100 pC/g.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the peak amplification of 5 cm into meters (0.05 m) and then into acceleration using the formula a = (2 * π * f)^2 * x, where f is the frequency and x is the peak displacement.\n\nGiven the frequency is up to 2 Hz, the maximum acceleration (peak to peak) a_max will be:\n\na_max = (2 * π * 2)^2 * 0.05 m = (4 * π)^2 * 0.05 m ≈ 39.478 m/s²\n\nSince 1 g ≈ 9.80665 m/s², the acceleration in terms of g is:\n\na_max_g = 39.478 m/s² / 9.80665 m/s² ≈ 4.027 g\n\nNow, using the sensitivity of 100 pC/g, the maximum expected charge Qmax is:\n\nQmax = sensitivity * a_max_g = 100 pC/g * 4.027 g ≈ 402.7 pC\n\nTherefore, the maximum expected charge due to the largest expected vibration amplitude is approximately 402.7 pC.\n```\n",
