Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design details a potentiometer-based angle sensor system with a signal conditioning block, a filtering block, and an ADC block for interfacing with a DAQ system. Here are the evaluations based on the given requirements:

1. The potentiometer is correctly used as a voltage divider within its operating voltage range of -10V to 10V.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the specified +/- 10 V range.
3. The architecture is simple and includes a voltage divider, amplification block (which could act as a buffer), and a filtering block before the DAQ.
4. The input voltage range of the DAQ is correctly centered at 0, with a +/- 7 V range as specified.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is set to be within 7 V, which is ensured by the design of the amplification block and protection block.
6. The filtering block includes a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz, which serves as an anti-aliasing filter.
7. A Twin-T Notch Filter is implemented to attenuate 50 and 60 Hz frequencies, satisfying the requirement for removing these frequencies.
8. The low-pass filter in the protection block with a cutoff frequency around 250 Hz does not meet the requirement of achieving at least -20 dB gain at 500 Hz. The anti-aliasing filter should have a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain at 500 Hz is at least -20 dB, but the information provided does not confirm this.

The project design meets most of the requirements, but there is a potential issue with the low-pass filter's ability to achieve the required gain at 500 Hz. The filter's cutoff frequency and order are critical to ensure the -20 dB gain at 500 Hz, and this aspect is not adequately addressed in the description provided. Therefore, without confirmation that the filter achieves the required attenuation at 500 Hz, the project cannot be considered optimal.
