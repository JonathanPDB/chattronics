Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water Beaker

This summary outlines the design of an analog temperature measurement system using an NTC thermistor to measure the temperature of water in a beaker, where the measured temperature is converted to a voltage range of 0-20V for reading with a multimeter.

NTC Thermistor Sensor (NTCLE100E3):
- Selected Sensor: Standard NTCLE100E3103JB0 with a resistance of 10k ohms at 25°C and a Beta value of approximately 3977K.
- Linearization: Resistor in parallel with the NTC thermistor, value chosen to match the thermistor's resistance at 50°C.
- Self-heating: Power dissipation to be kept below 0.1W to ensure minimal self-heating.
- Protective Coating: Chemically inert and waterproof coating for protection in the water environment.

Linearization Network:
- Linearization Approach: Parallel resistor with the thermistor to linearize the response at 50°C.
- Resistor Value (Rp): Close to the thermistor's resistance at 50°C, R50 = R25 * exp(-Beta * ((1/323.15) - (1/298.15))).

Buffer Amplifier:
- Topology: Unity-Gain Buffer using an operational amplifier.
- Selected Op-Amp: FET input or precision op-amp (e.g., TL081) to minimize input bias current and offset voltage.
- Output Impedance: Less than 10 Ohms.
- Supply Voltage: At least ±15V.

Amplification and Scaling:
- Required Gain (Av): 20 (Assuming Vsensor_max is 1V).
- Amplifier Configuration: Non-inverting amplifier with precision resistors.
- Supply Voltage: Minimum 24V to allow headroom.
- Op-Amp: Low-noise, precision, single-supply operational amplifier (e.g., OPAx177).
- Gain Adjustment: Multi-turn trimming potentiometer for calibration.
- Precision Resistors: 0.1% tolerance.

Low-Pass Filter:
- Cutoff Frequency (fc): 2 Hz.
- Order: Second order (Sallen-Key topology suggested).
- Component Values: R1 = R2 = 39k ohms, C1 = C2 = 2.0 uF.
- Op-Amp: Low-frequency operational amplifier (e.g., TL072, LM358).

Output Voltage (0-20V):
- Measurement Equipment: Digital multimeter with high input impedance (at least 10 MΩ), accurate to ±(0.5% + a few digits), and with a resolution of at least 10 mV.
- Example Multimeter: Fluke 87V Industrial Multimeter.
- Measurement Technique: Use short, twisted pair leads, shielded cables, and ensure environmental noise minimization.
- Calibration: Regular calibration against known voltage reference and temperature standard.
- Thermal Stabilization: Allow the system to thermally stabilize before taking measurements.

The above design considerations and components will provide a robust solution for measuring the temperature of water in a beaker and converting it to a 0-20V signal that can be read using a multimeter.
