Design of a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Architecture Overview:
The proposed architecture is divided into several key blocks: Piezoelectric Accelerometer, Charge Amplifier, Low-Pass Filter, Buffer, Anti-Aliasing Filter, ADC, and Microcontroller.

Piezoelectric Accelerometer:
- Selected Model: PCB Piezotronics 352A60 or equivalent with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g and a high impedance suitable for low-frequency measurements.
- The accelerometer should withstand typical indoor and outdoor environmental conditions with an operating temperature range of -55°C to +125°C.

Charge Amplifier:
- Operational Amplifier: Low-noise, precision FET input op-amp (e.g., Texas Instruments OPAx132 series or Analog Devices AD823 series).
- Gain: 1 V peak-to-peak voltage output for a 0.51 pC input charge from the accelerometer. A gain of 1.96x10^12 V/C is needed. Practical component values for feedback capacitor and resistor (Cf and Rf) need to be selected based on the op-amp's performance and the accelerometer's capacitance.
- Power Supply: Designed for a single +5V supply with a full swing around the mid-supply voltage.

Low-Pass Filter:
- Topology: Butterworth Active Low-Pass Filter for a flat passband response.
- Order: Second-order (2 poles) for sufficient roll-off while maintaining reasonable complexity.
- Cutoff Frequency (f_c): 2 Hz to attenuate frequencies higher than the frequency of interest and prevent aliasing.
- Components: Standard values for Butterworth filters with resistor (R) and capacitor (C) based on the desired bandwidth and cutoff frequency.

Buffer:
- Op-Amp: Rail-to-rail input/output op-amp with low offset voltage (<1 mV) and low noise characteristics (e.g., Texas Instruments OPA344 or Analog Devices AD8605).
- Configuration: Voltage follower (unity gain buffer) to provide a low impedance output.
- Power Supply: +5V single supply, with the output range approximately 0 to 5V.

Anti-Aliasing Filter:
- Topology: Butterworth filter with a critically damped response for maximizing flatness in the passband.
- Order: 2nd order, with the flexibility to increase to a 4th order if needed for additional attenuation.
- Cutoff Frequency: 4 Hz, slightly above the highest frequency of interest for the signal.
- Attenuation: At least 40-60 dB by the Nyquist frequency.

ADC:
- Type: Sigma-Delta (Σ-Δ) ADC for high resolution and low-frequency operation. Low power variants are preferred for portability.
- Resolution: 24 bits to accurately capture small variations in vibration.
- Sampling Rate: 10 samples per second (sps) to provide a good margin above the Nyquist criterion.
- Dynamic Range & SNR: A dynamic range of 144 dB (theoretical maximum for 24 bits) and a practical SNR greater than 100 dB.
- THD & SFDR: ADC with a THD less than -100 dB and SFDR greater than 100 dB.

Microcontroller:
- Selection based on processing capabilities, I/O requirements, communication interfaces, power consumption, and environmental robustness.
- Recommended microcontroller: Low-power ARM Cortex-M4 or M0+ for their power efficiency, DSP instructions, and wide range of communication interfaces.
- Wireless Communication: Options such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for remote data monitoring.
- Data Analysis and Logging: Custom software using C/C++ or Python or using existing software like LabVIEW or MATLAB.

The complete solution provided includes all necessary steps and calculations to design each block of the system, ensuring that the final device can measure low-frequency vibrations accurately within the specified parameters.
