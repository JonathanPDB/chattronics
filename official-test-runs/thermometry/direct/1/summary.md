Water Temperature Measurement System Design

This summary outlines the design and implementation details for a project that measures the temperature of water using a thermistor and outputs a corresponding voltage.

NTC Thermistor Sensor:
- Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor, typically 10 kOhms at 25°C.
- Linearization with a fixed resistor in parallel at the midpoint (50°C), calculated based on the thermistor's resistance-temperature characteristic.

Temperature to Voltage Conversion:
- Wheatstone bridge circuit with the NTCLE100E3 as one arm.
- Precision resistors of 10 kOhms for other bridge arms.
- Assumed bridge excitation voltage: 24V for sufficient headroom.
- Output from bridge expected to be in millivolts range, corresponding linearly to the temperature range of 10 to 90°C.

Amplification and Scaling:
- Non-inverting amplifier configuration using an operational amplifier.
- Op-amp powered by a dual supply of ±15V for a wide output voltage swing.
- Gain set using precision resistors (1% tolerance) to scale bridge output to 0-20V range.
- Gain approximation = Output Voltage Range / Bridge Output Range (calculated based on actual values during implementation).

Anti-Aliasing Filter:
- Active 2nd-order Butterworth Low-Pass Filter.
- Cutoff frequency: 10 Hz (based on slow-changing nature of temperature).
- Selected op-amp: Low-noise type like TL072.
- Precision components for filter: 1% tolerance.

Output Buffer:
- Unity-gain voltage follower buffer configuration.
- LM324 or equivalent op-amp with low offset voltage and output impedance.
- Supply Voltage: 24V single supply with virtual ground if needed.
- Protection with input and output resistors (1 kOhms) and clamp diodes.

Multimeter:
- High-impedance digital multimeter with a voltage measurement range of at least 0 to 20 volts.
- Auto-ranging capability preferred for convenience.

Additional Details:
- Self-heating effect of the thermistor kept under 1% by minimizing power dissipation.
- Stability and thermal considerations addressed in the layout and component selection.
- Calibration and verification against known temperature sources before use.

The above components and configurations provide a robust system for accurately measuring water temperature and outputting a corresponding voltage to be measured by a multimeter.
