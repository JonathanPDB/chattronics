Score: 4
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) is given as 79.6 MΩ and the feedback capacitance (Cf) is 8 nF. Multiplying these gives a time constant (τ = Rf * Cf) of 636.8 s, which is not around 2/pi (approximately 0.637 s). Therefore, this requirement is not met.

2. Using the given values, the term (G * 1.61p / Cf) becomes (1 * 1.61p / 8nF) which equals 201.25 V, not approximately 1 as required. Hence, this requirement is not fulfilled.

3. The peak charge output is calculated from the accelerometer sensitivity and peak acceleration, which is 4 pC, not the required 161 pC.

4. The bias current is provided, specified as typically 1 pA.

5. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (Rf) is 0.01 / 79.6 MΩ = 1.26e-10 A or 0.126 pA, which does not equal the given bias current of 1 pA. This requirement is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2Hz and 5cm amplitude. Calculations are provided to confirm the requirement.

8. The output voltage is designed to be 1V peak-to-peak.

9. The output offset voltage is designed to be less than 10 mV.
