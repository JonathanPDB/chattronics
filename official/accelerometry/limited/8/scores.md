Score: 3
Explanations: 
Evaluating the project summary against the provided requirements:

1. The feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance must be roughly around 2/pi: This value is not provided in the summary, so we cannot confirm if this requirement is met.

2. The charge amplifier gain multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (G x 1.61p / Cf) should be roughly around 1: The gain of the charge amplifier is given as 1.96x10^12 V/C, but the feedback capacitance (Cf) is not provided, so this requirement cannot be confirmed.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC: The summary specifies a 1 V peak-to-peak output for a 0.51 pC input charge, which does not meet the requirement for a 161 pC output.

4. The bias current must be provided: The summary does not mention the bias current.

5. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current: Since the bias current and feedback resistance are not provided, this requirement cannot be confirmed.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor: This requirement is met as the summary clearly states a charge amplifier is used in conjunction with a piezoelectric accelerometer.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude and has calculations to back it up: The summary mentions a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz, which implies optimization for low-frequency measurements, but does not specify the 5 cm amplitude or provide calculations, so this is only partially met.

8. The output voltage is 1 V peak to peak: This requirement is met as specified in the summary.

9. The offset should be kept below 10 mV: The summary specifies the use of an op-amp with an offset voltage of less than 1 mV, which meets this requirement.

Based on the information provided, the project summary meets requirements 6, 8, and 9. Requirements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 cannot be confirmed based on the given information.
