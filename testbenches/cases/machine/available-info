1. The accuracy should be at least of 1%
2. The pressure sensors have a maximum output of 1 mV
3. Temperature sensors are radiation detectors having a maximum output of 100 m V
4. Temperature sensors have a nonlinear scale
5. Strain-gauge should be used as the pressure sensor
6. Infrared radiation detectors should be used for the surface temperature sensor.
7. Assume all pressure sensors have identical sensitivity
8. Signal frequencies of 400 Hz are expected
9. Frequencies higher than 400 Hz (if present) need not be recorded.
10. The ADC should be a SAR
