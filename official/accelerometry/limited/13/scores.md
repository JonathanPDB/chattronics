Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) are given as 10 MÎ© and 1 nF, respectively. The product Rf x Cf = 10e6 x 1e-9 = 0.01 s. This product should be roughly around 2/pi (approximately 0.637), but it is not. Hence, requirement 1 is not met.

2. The charge amplifier gain is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer it from the additional gain stage, which has a gain of approximately 12.66. If we assume the charge amplifier has a gain of 1 (since it's not stated and it's a common practice to have a unity gain in the first stage), then G = 12.66. The feedback capacitance (Cf) is 1 nF. So, G x 1.61p / Cf = 12.66 x 1.61e-12 / 1e-9 = 0.0203866, which is not close to 1. Therefore, requirement 2 is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated at 79 pC (sensitivity of 100 pC/g at 0.79g), which does not meet the requirement of around 161 pC. Hence, requirement 3 is not met.

4. The bias current is not provided; there is only a mention of an operational amplifier with ultra-low offset voltage and bias current. Without specific values, requirement 4 is not met.

5. To check if requirement 5 is met, we would need the bias current value. Since it's not provided, we cannot verify this requirement, so it is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor. This is consistent with the information provided, so requirement 6 is met.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, with calculations provided for the accelerometer's sensitivity and estimated max acceleration. Therefore, requirement 7 is met.

8. The output voltage is not explicitly stated to be 1 V peak-to-peak, but there is a mention of a required gain (Av) of 100 to amplify the charge amplifier output to 1 Vpp. This implies that the output voltage is designed to be 1 V peak-to-peak, so requirement 8 is met.

9. The offset voltage requirement is only mentioned in the context of the operational amplifier (AD8628) characteristics. There is no explicit confirmation that the system's offset is kept below 10 mV, so requirement 9 is not met.
