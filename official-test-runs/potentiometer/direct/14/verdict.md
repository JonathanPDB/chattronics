Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The provided summary of the pendulum angle measurement system design covers a range of components and design considerations that are relevant to the project requirements. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, fulfilling requirement 1. The power supply for the buffer stage is +/-10V, which aligns with requirement 2. The architecture appears to be simple and includes a voltage divider, buffer stage, and filters, consistent with requirement 3.

However, there are some issues with the design that need to be addressed:

- The differential amplifier is designed to have a gain of 1.4 to map the potentiometer output of -5V to +5V to the DAQ input of -7V to +7V. While this meets requirement 4, it is not clear if the potentiometer output range is indeed -5V to +5V, as the power supply is +/-10V. If the potentiometer output range is larger than -5V to +5V, then the DAQ input could exceed the maximum voltage of 7V, violating requirement 5.

- The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency of 200 Hz, which should help to avoid aliasing, fulfilling requirement 6. However, the order of the filter and the exact attenuation at 500 Hz are not specified, making it unclear if the -20 dB gain at 500 Hz requirement (requirement 8) is met.

- The band-stop filter is designed to attenuate frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz by -40 dB, which should effectively remove these frequencies, meeting requirement 7.

- There is no explicit mention of a level shifter in the architecture, but there is a description of a level shifter in the summary. This is necessary to ensure the DAQ input is centered at 0V, as per requirement 4.

Given the issues with the differential amplifier's gain and the lack of detail on the anti-aliasing filter's performance at 500 Hz, the project cannot be classified as "optimal." Additionally, since the maximum allowed voltage for the DAQ is 7V and it is not clear that this requirement is consistently met, there is a potential fatal issue. However, the design is conceptually correct and could be implemented after addressing these concerns. Therefore, the verdict is "acceptable."
