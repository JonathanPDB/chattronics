The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V\n3. The architecture is simple: there is a voltage divider (with or without a voltage buffer), an anti-aliasing filter and then the DAQ measures the voltage.\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered in 0, for example, +/- 7V.\n5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n6. The is a low pass filter (or anti-aliasing filter) that avoids a aliasing\n7. There is a filter removing frequencies between around 50 and 60 Hz\n8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz\n\nYou will categorize the summary into 1 of 5 categories:\n\"optimal\" - use this if the all requirements were reached\n\"acceptable\" - use this category if the project can be implemented and doesn't have any fatal issues, but the score isn't perfect.\n\"generic\" - use this category if the project is theoretically correct and can be implemented, but too generic to have real value.\n\"unfeasible\" - use this if the project is theoretically correct, but contains elements that makes it impossible to implement\n\"incorrect\" - the information provided is conceptually wrong\n\nRequirements marked as essential must be fulfilled in order for a good verdict.\nYou must think as a project designer if the solution is applicable and well thought out.\n\nYou will provide explanations regarding your verdict, the explanations must explicitly indicate which requirements were not reached.\nYou always follow the exact following template in markdown blocks, where all caps words are placeholders for you to fill in.\nInside the verdict placeholder, you will provide only the chosen category.\n\n\n```explanations\nEXPLANATIONS HERE\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nVERDICT_CATEGORY\n```\n\n"

With Ri = 10 kΩ, we get Rf = 6.5 kΩ.\n\nNotch Filter Component Selection:\nFor 50 Hz, we use the formula C = 1 / (2 * π * f * R), with R = 10 kΩ and f = 50 Hz, yielding C ≈ 3.18 nF. Similarly, for 60 Hz, with R = 10 kΩ, we get C ≈ 265 nF.\n\nAnti-aliasing Filter Design:\nWith the cutoff frequency (fc) set just below 500 Hz, we use R = 10 kΩ and calculate C using C = 1 / (2 * π * fc * R), resulting in C ≈ 3.3 μF as the nearest standard value.\n\nWith the information provided and under the assumption of an indoor application without extreme environmental conditions, these selections and calculations form the basis for a robust pendulum angle measurement system suited for general use."

    "response": "```explanations\nThe project design for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System generally meets several of the key requirements, but there are some issues that need to be addressed.\n\n- The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, which aligns with the first requirement.\n- The +/- 10V voltage applied to the potentiometer meets the second requirement.\n- The architecture includes a voltage divider, a buffer amplifier, a level shifter, notch filters, an anti-aliasing filter, and a gain stage before the DAQ, which is somewhat more complex than the simple architecture described in the third requirement. However, this complexity may be justified by the need to meet the other requirements.\n- The level shifter is designed to adjust the voltage range to fit within the DAQ's +/- 7V input range, which aligns with the fourth requirement.\n- The notch filters and the anti-aliasing filter are included, which is consistent with the sixth and seventh requirements to avoid aliasing and remove 50-60 Hz frequencies.\n- The filter's cutoff frequency is set just below 500 Hz, and a second-order Butterworth filter is used, which should ensure that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, complying with the eighth requirement.\n\nHowever, there are potential issues:\n- The gain stage is set to a gain of 0.65, but no justification is provided for this value. This could be problematic if the resulting signal does not utilize the full range of the DAQ's input voltage.\n- It is not clear if the anti-aliasing filter's gain at 500 Hz is at least -20 dB, as the exact cutoff frequency and order of the filter are not specified.\n- The level shifter design does not seem to be centered at 0V, which could be an issue if the DAQ requires a centered input voltage.\n\nThese issues need to be addressed in order for the project to fully meet the specified requirements.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
