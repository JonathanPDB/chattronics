It also translates the -10V to +10V range to fit within the DAQ's input range of -7V to +7V. A simple op-amp circuit can be employed to add the required DC offset.\n\nGainStage: The GainStage is used to adjust the amplitude of the signal so that the entire dynamic range of the DAQ is utilized. This block will scale the potentiometer voltage, which spans the 45 to 135 degrees range, to fit within the DAQ's maximum voltage range. An operational amplifier configured for the appropriate gain can be used.\n\nLowPassFilter: This block is a low-pass filter that removes high-frequency noise above the desired signal bandwidth.

    "response": "```Details\nLowPassFilter\n\nGiven the application context - a pendulum's angular position measurement - the frequency content of interest is generally low, since pendulum movements are typically slow compared to electronic signal dynamics. For this project, the key requirements for the low-pass filter (LPF) are to allow the pendulum's signal through while attenuating unwanted high-frequency noise, including 50 and 60 Hz interference from power lines and preventing aliasing due to the DAQ's sampling rate.\n\nTopology Suggestion:\nAn active second-order (or higher) Butterworth low-pass filter is recommended for this application, as it provides a maximally flat passband which is desirable for maintaining the fidelity of the angle measurement. The active design, using operational amplifiers, will offer better performance in terms of input and output impedance matching.\n\nCutoff Frequency:\nThe cutoff frequency should be chosen to be well below the Nyquist frequency of 500 Hz (half the DAQ's 1000 Hz sampling rate) to avoid aliasing. A reasonable cutoff frequency could be set around 100 Hz, which is high enough to capture the pendulum's dynamics without attenuation but low enough to attenuate any high-frequency noise.\n\nFilter Order:\nA second-order filter provides a 12 dB/octave roll-off which is often sufficient for many applications. However, if a sharper roll-off is required to better reject noise and prevent aliasing, a fourth-order filter (24 dB/octave) could be used.\n\nDamping Values:\nThe Butterworth filter inherently has a damping ratio (ζ) of 0.707 for a second-order filter, which ensures a maximally flat frequency response in the passband without any ripple.\n\nComponents:\n- Operational Amplifiers (e.g., LM358 or TL072 for low noise)\n- Resistors and Capacitors for setting the cutoff frequency and filter order\n\nThe specific values for resistors and capacitors in the filter would be calculated based on the chosen cutoff frequency and the operational amplifier's characteristics, using standard filter design equations. For a second-order Butterworth LPF with a 100 Hz cutoff frequency using a standard op-amp like the TL072, the component values could be approximately:\n- Resistors: R1 = R2 = 16 kΩ\n- Capacitors: C1 = C2 = 100 nF\n\nThese values provide a starting point that may need to be fine-tuned based on the actual behavior of the pendulum and the specific characteristics of the DAQ system. Simulation and prototyping would ideally be used to refine these values for the final design.\n```",

The Twin-T offers simplicity but is less stable compared to the Multiple Feedback design, which is more precise and allows for better control over the filter parameters.\n\nI will suggest a Multiple Feedback Notch Filter, as it provides better performance and stability which is important for accurate sensor readings.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Type: Active Notch Filter\n- Configuration: Multiple Feedback\n- Order: Second-order (this should be sufficient for narrow-bandwidth attenuation)\n- Center Frequencies: 50 Hz and 60 Hz (We may need two separate notch filters or one with a slightly wider notch to cover both frequencies)\n- Attenuation at Center Frequencies: At least -20 dB (This value should significantly reduce the noise without complex circuitry)\n- Quality Factor (Q): Between 10 and 30 (Higher Q for narrow bandwidth and greater attenuation)\n- Bandwidth: Defined by the Q factor (A higher Q results in a narrower bandwidth)\n\nComponents and Values:\n- Operational Amplifiers: Choose low-noise, precision op-amps like the LM358 or OP07 for better performance.\n- Resistors \u0026 Capacitors: Use 1% metal film resistors and film capacitors for better stability and lower tolerance.\n\nTo calculate the component values for each center frequency (f0), use the standard notch filter design equations:\n- f0 = 1 / (2 * π * √(R1*R2*C1*C2))\n- Q = √(R1/R2) / (2 * π * f0 * C1)\n\nFor a 50 Hz notch filter, assuming a Q of 10:\n- Choose C1 = C2 = 10 nF (arbitrary choice, C values typically chosen first in filter design)\n- Calculate R1 and R2 using the above equations to get the desired f0 and Q\n\nFor a 60 Hz notch filter, repeat the process with the respective frequency.\n\nThe two filters can be implemented separately or designed to have overlapping notches if a single filter with a wider notch is preferred.\n\nRanges to be filtered out:\n- Frequencies around 50 Hz and 60 Hz, with a notch width determined by the Q factor. The width should be narrow enough to avoid affecting the pendulum's signal frequencies but wide enough to account for possible variations in the noise frequencies.\n\nRanges to be kept in:\n- Frequencies outside the notch bandwidth, especially in the range of the pendulum's expected signal frequency (which is low and will likely be below 10 Hz), should not be affected by the filter.\n\nBy using these active notch filters, the DAQ will receive a cleaner signal from the potentiometer, with significant attenuation of the 50 Hz and 60 Hz interference, without the need to alter the DAQ's configuration or the input signal range.\n```",

As the pendulum swings, it changes the resistance proportionally to its angle. The potentiometer converts the mechanical angle into a corresponding voltage signal. The range of -10V to 10V across the potentiometer is mapped to the angle range of 45 to 135 degrees, with 90 degrees corresponding to 0V.\n\nOffsetAdjustment: This block applies an offset voltage to the signal from the potentiometer to ensure that the steady position of 90 degrees corresponds to 0V. It also translates the -10V to +10V range to fit within the DAQ's input range of -7V to +7V. A simple op-amp circuit can be employed to add the required DC offset.\n\nGainStage: The GainStage is used to adjust the amplitude of the signal so that the entire dynamic range of the DAQ is utilized. This block will scale the potentiometer voltage, which spans the 45 to 135 degrees range, to fit within the DAQ's maximum voltage range. An operational amplifier configured for the appropriate gain can be used.\n\nLowPassFilter: This block is a low-pass filter that removes high-frequency noise above the desired signal bandwidth. Considering the sampling rate of the DAQ and the nature of the pendulum's movement, a cutoff frequency lower than half the sampling rate of the DAQ (Nyquist frequency) is chosen to prevent aliasing.\n\nNotchFilter: A notch filter is used to attenuate frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which are common noise frequencies due to electrical power lines. This filter is especially important for rejecting power line interference which could corrupt the measurement.\n\nAntiAliasingFilter: An anti-aliasing filter is implemented right before the DAQ to ensure that any high-frequency signal components that could cause aliasing are sufficiently attenuated. This is a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency set below the Nyquist rate of the DAQ, commonly chosen to be about half the sampling rate (500 Hz in this case).\n\nDAQ: This block represents the Data Acquisition system that samples the analog signal. It is configured to sample at a rate of 1000 samples per second. The DAQ digitizes the conditioned analog signal from the potentiometer for further processing or analysis.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nANTI_ALIASING_FILTER_BLOCK\n\nGiven the lack of specific requirements, I will suggest a reasonable anti-aliasing filter design for the pendulum angle measurement system. The primary goal of the anti-aliasing filter is to prevent frequencies higher than half the sampling rate (500 Hz in this case) from being sampled, which can cause aliasing.\n\nTopology: Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Butterworth filters provide a maximally flat frequency response in the passband, which will preserve the shape of the pendulum's motion waveform without introducing ripple.\n\nOrder: Second-Order (2 poles)\n- A second-order filter provides a balance between complexity and performance. It has a roll-off rate of -12 dB/octave (or -40 dB/decade), which is generally sufficient to attenuate unwanted frequencies before reaching the Nyquist frequency.\n\nCutoff Frequency: 250 Hz\n- A cutoff frequency of 250 Hz is chosen because it is half the Nyquist frequency. This allows the filter to attenuate signals close to the Nyquist frequency while providing enough bandwidth for the pendulum's motion frequencies.\n\nComponents:\n- Operational Amplifier: A low-noise, rail-to-rail op-amp with a high slew rate to maintain signal fidelity.\n- Resistors \u0026 Capacitors: Precision resistors and capacitors with low temperature coefficients to ensure stable filter characteristics over temperature variations.\n\nDamping Factor (Q): 0.7071 (Critical Damping)\n- A damping factor of 0.7071 is characteristic of a Butterworth filter which ensures no resonance peak in the frequency response.\n\nAttenuation at Nyquist Frequency (500 Hz): At least -24 dB\n- Given that the roll-off rate is -12 dB/octave, the attenuation at 500 Hz (double the cutoff frequency) will be at least -24 dB, which is generally considered sufficient for preventing aliasing.\n\nWith this configuration, the filter will have a flat passband up to 250 Hz, ensuring accurate representation of the pendulum motion frequencies and attenuating high-frequency noise that could cause aliasing in the DAQ.\n\nRanges to be filtered out: Frequencies above 250 Hz will be progressively attenuated, with strong attenuation by 500 Hz to avoid aliasing in the sampled data.\n\nThis design is a good balance between simplicity and effectiveness for a wide range of applications. If in practice the system requires more aggressive attenuation near the Nyquist frequency, a higher order filter or an additional stage could be added.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nADC_BLOCK\n\nGiven the requirements and constraints of the project, the ADC block should aim for simplicity and compatibility with the DAQ's sampling rate and input voltage range. The following specifications and topology suggestions are made:\n\n1. **Resolution**: For a pendulum angle measurement, a 12-bit ADC would likely provide sufficient resolution. This would give us 4096 distinct levels over the full range of the DAQ, which, for a voltage range of +/-7V, gives a theoretical resolution of approximately 3.4 mV per bit.\n\n2. **Sampling Rate**: The DAQ is capable of 1000 samples per second, so the ADC should match this rate to ensure no loss of data. This rate is more than sufficient for capturing the dynamics of a pendulum since its movements are relatively slow. \n\n3. **Input Voltage Range**: The ADC must be compatible with the input range of +/-7V. If the ADC chosen has a different input range, a scaling circuit might be necessary to match the input range of the ADC to that of the analog output from the signal conditioning circuit.\n\n4. **Input Impedance**: A high input impedance is preferred for the ADC to minimize loading effects on the signal conditioning circuitry. Typically, this would be in the megaohm range.\n\n5. **Anti-Aliasing Filter**: Since the DAQ cannot be altered, and assuming it does not have a built-in anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz (half the sampling rate), an external anti-aliasing filter must be implemented in the signal conditioning stage to prevent aliasing.\n\n6. **Type of ADC**: A successive approximation register (SAR) ADC topology would be suitable for this application due to its good balance between speed, accuracy, and cost.\n\n7. **Accuracy and Linearity**: The ADC should have good accuracy and linearity to ensure the angular measurements are reliable. The accuracy should be within a few least significant bits (LSBs) to avoid significant error in angle measurement.\n\n8. **Interface**: The ADC must have an interface compatible with the DAQ system. Typically, this would be a serial interface such as SPI or I2C, or parallel for higher data transfer rates if the DAQ supports it.\n\n9. **Power Supply**: The ADC must operate within the voltage supply available in the system, which should be considered during the signal conditioning design as well.\n\nConclusion: A 12-bit SAR ADC with a sampling rate of at least 1000 samples per second, high input impedance, serial or parallel interface, and an input voltage range that matches the conditioned signal should be used. An external anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency below 500 Hz will be included in the signal conditioning stage to prepare the analog signal for digitization by the ADC. The specific choice of ADC chip would need to be based on availability and compatibility with the rest of the system.\n```",

As the pendulum swings, it changes the resistance proportionally to its angle. The potentiometer converts the mechanical angle into a corresponding voltage signal. The range of -10V to 10V across the potentiometer is mapped to the angle range of 45 to 135 degrees, with 90 degrees corresponding to 0V.\n\nOffsetAdjustment: This block applies an offset voltage to the signal from the potentiometer to ensure that the steady position of 90 degrees corresponds to 0V. It also translates the -10V to +10V range to fit within the DAQ's input range of -7V to +7V. A simple op-amp circuit can be employed to add the required DC offset.\n\nGainStage: The GainStage is used to adjust the amplitude of the signal so that the entire dynamic range of the DAQ is utilized. This block will scale the potentiometer voltage, which spans the 45 to 135 degrees range, to fit within the DAQ's maximum voltage range. An operational amplifier configured for the appropriate gain can be used.\n\nLowPassFilter: This block is a low-pass filter that removes high-frequency noise above the desired signal bandwidth. Considering the sampling rate of the DAQ and the nature of the pendulum's movement, a cutoff frequency lower than half the sampling rate of the DAQ (Nyquist frequency) is chosen to prevent aliasing.\n\nNotchFilter: A notch filter is used to attenuate frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which are common noise frequencies due to electrical power lines. This filter is especially important for rejecting power line interference which could corrupt the measurement.\n\nAntiAliasingFilter: An anti-aliasing filter is implemented right before the DAQ to ensure that any high-frequency signal components that could cause aliasing are sufficiently attenuated. This is a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency set below the Nyquist rate of the DAQ, commonly chosen to be about half the sampling rate (500 Hz in this case).\n\nDAQ: This block represents the Data Acquisition system that samples the analog signal. It is configured to sample at a rate of 1000 samples per second. The DAQ digitizes the conditioned analog signal from the potentiometer for further processing or analysis.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nPOTENTIOMETER_SENSOR_BLOCK\n\nType and Model of Sensor: For this application, a precision conductive plastic potentiometer with a linear taper is recommended because of its good linearity, reliability, and long life, which are ideal for accurate angle measurements. A suitable model could be the Bourns 3549 series.\n\nOperational Temperature Range: Assuming a general indoor environment, a temperature range of 0°C to 70°C should cover most situations. The Bourns 3549 series operates within this range.\n\nResolution: The resolution of the potentiometer is determined by its mechanical design and the voltage resolution of the DAQ. With a 10 kOhm potentiometer and a DAQ that can measure small voltage changes, the resolution should be sufficient for detecting minute changes in angle. The actual resolution in degrees will also depend on the voltage span corresponding to the angle range. Since the potentiometer is linear, the resolution in degrees is even across the span.\n\nSensitivity: The sensitivity of the potentiometer is the change in output voltage per degree of rotation. Given the voltage range of -10V to +10V for an angle range of 45 to 135 degrees, the sensitivity is 20V / 90 degrees = 0.222V/degree.\n\nPower Rating: Potentiometers typically support low current levels, so the power rating is not expected to be a major constraint. A standard potentiometer can handle power levels around 0.5W to 1W which is sufficient for this low-current application.\n\nVoltage and Current Limits: The potentiometer's maximum voltage rating is well within the provided power source range of -10V to +10V. To protect the DAQ, ensure that the current through the potentiometer does not exceed the input current limits of the DAQ. This can be assured by the high resistance (10 kOhm) which limits the current to 1 mA at 10V.\n\nDurability: Continuous or frequent movement can wear down a potentiometer. The Bourns 3549 series has a rotational life of up to 10 million cycles, which should be adequate for most pendulum applications unless it's used in a highly rigorous industrial setting.\n\nTo summarize, the Bourns 3549 series conductive plastic potentiometer, with its 10 kOhm resistance, linear taper, and suitable temperature range, is a good fit for this project. It provides an adequate resolution for angle measurement, the sensitivity is appropriate for the voltage range, and its durability matches the expected use case.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nOFFSET_ADJUSTMENT_BLOCK\n\nFor the Offset Adjustment block, we must create a circuit that translates the voltage range of the potentiometer (corresponding to the pendulum's angle of movement from 45 to 135 degrees) into a range suitable for the DAQ's input. Since the DAQ can handle a maximum of +/- 7 V and we know that 90 degrees corresponds to the steady position, we can infer that 90 degrees should correspond to 0 V output to the DAQ.\n\nGiven the linear relationship between the angle and voltage of the potentiometer and the requirement that 90 degrees corresponds to 0 V, we will center our output voltage swing around 0 V. The potentiometer provides a full scale of -10 V to +10 V, which corresponds to a 90-degree swing in both directions from the 90-degree steady state, so we need to scale this down to the DAQ's range of +/- 7 V to correspond to 45 degrees on either side of the steady state.\n\nA simple way to achieve this is to use a non-inverting summing amplifier configuration. The summing amplifier will allow us to add a DC offset to the signal and scale it to fit within the DAQ's input range.\n\nThe following components are suggested for the Offset Adjustment block:\n\n1. Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp): A precision rail-to-rail op-amp (for example, the ADA4077-2 from Analog Devices) that can operate with a single supply spanning the -10 V to +10 V range.\n2. Resistors: Precision resistors with a low temperature coefficient to ensure stability over varying temperatures. For instance, a 1% metal film resistor can be used.\n\nBelow is the proposed circuit topology for the Offset Adjustment block with example resistor values calculated for the desired voltage scaling:\n\n- V+: Connected to +10 V\n- V-: Connected to -10 V\n- R1: 10 kOhm (Input resistor)\n- R2: 14 kOhm (Feedback resistor)\n- R3: 14 kOhm (Grounding resistor for creating virtual ground at half-supply)\n- R4: 20 kOhm (Voltage divider resistor, paired with R5, to set appropriate offset)\n- R5: 20 kOhm (Voltage divider resistor, paired with R4)\n- RV1: 10 kOhm trim pot (Optional, for fine adjustment of offset)\n- Vout: Output to DAQ\n\nThe voltage divider created by R4 and R5 sets a reference voltage at half the supply voltage (0 V), which is the desired output for the steady state (90 degrees). The non-inverting input of the op-amp is connected to this reference voltage. The potentiometer's output is fed to the inverting input through R1. The feedback resistor R2, together with R1, sets the gain of the amplifier to scale the input voltage to fit within the DAQ's range. R3 ensures that the virtual ground is stable.\n\nIf manual adjustability for offset is required, RV1 can be included in series with R4 or R5 for fine-tuning. If not, the trim pot can be omitted, and fixed resistor values can be used.\n\nThis circuit will provide an adjustable voltage centered around 0 V, scaling the input from -10 V to +10 V to an output suitable for the DAQ's range of +/- 7 V, with 0 V corresponding to the 90-degree steady position of the pendulum.\n```",

Given the specified angle range of 45° to 135°, with 90° corresponding to the steady position and 0V output, the potentiometer will theoretically output a voltage range of -5V to 5V (assuming the center tap of the potentiometer produces 0V at 90° and the voltage scales linearly with angle).\n\nTo conform to the DAQ's maximum input voltage of ±7V and assuming the worst-case scenario where the output of the potentiometer swing is -5V to 5V, we will design the GainStage such that it does not amplify this signal beyond the DAQ's limit.\n\nHowever, to utilize the full dynamic range of the DAQ, the output voltage swing from the GainStage should be adjusted as close as possible to ±7V without exceeding it. Since the theoretical output voltage range of the potentiometer is -5V to 5V, a non-inverting amplifier topology can be used with an op-amp to achieve the necessary gain.\n\nGain calculation:\nVout_max / Vin_max = Gain\n±7V / ±5V = Gain\nGain = 1.4\n\nA non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 1.4 will amplify the -5V to 5V signal to -7V to 7V, which is within the DAQ's input voltage range. The gain is calculated as:\nGain = 1 + (Rf/Rin)\nChoosing Rin = 10kΩ, then Rf = 4kΩ.\n\nComponent selection and other considerations:\n- An operational amplifier with rail-to-rail output capability would be ideal to ensure the full voltage range is utilized.\n- The op-amp should have a low output impedance to drive the DAQ without distortion.\n- It should also have a low input bias current and low input offset voltage to minimize errors, especially important since the signal levels are relatively low.\n- Since frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz must be attenuated, the op-amp's frequency response should allow for the subsequent filter stages to perform effectively without introducing additional phase shifts or amplitude variations in that region.\n- It's assumed that the power supply for the op-amp can provide the necessary voltage levels and current for the chosen op-amp and expected load.\n\nWith these requirements, a suitable op-amp can be selected from a range of components that meet the specifications, such as the LM324 or TL084 for general-purpose applications, but the final choice may depend on factors such as cost, availability, and specific project constraints.\n```",

As the pendulum swings, it changes the resistance proportionally to its angle. The potentiometer converts the mechanical angle into a corresponding voltage signal. The range of -10V to 10V across the potentiometer is mapped to the angle range of 45 to 135 degrees, with 90 degrees corresponding to 0V.\n\nOffsetAdjustment: This block applies an offset voltage to the signal from the potentiometer to ensure that the steady position of 90 degrees corresponds to 0V. It also translates the -10V to +10V range to fit within the DAQ's input range of -7V to +7V. A simple op-amp circuit can be employed to add the required DC offset.\n\nGainStage: The GainStage is used to adjust the amplitude of the signal so that the entire dynamic range of the DAQ is utilized. This block will scale the potentiometer voltage, which spans the 45 to 135 degrees range, to fit within the DAQ's maximum voltage range. An operational amplifier configured for the appropriate gain can be used.\n\nLowPassFilter: This block is a low-pass filter that removes high-frequency noise above the desired signal bandwidth. Considering the sampling rate of the DAQ and the nature of the pendulum's movement, a cutoff frequency lower than half the sampling rate of the DAQ (Nyquist frequency) is chosen to prevent aliasing.\n\nNotchFilter: A notch filter is used to attenuate frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which are common noise frequencies due to electrical power lines. This filter is especially important for rejecting power line interference which could corrupt the measurement.\n\nAntiAliasingFilter: An anti-aliasing filter is implemented right before the DAQ to ensure that any high-frequency signal components that could cause aliasing are sufficiently attenuated. This is a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency set below the Nyquist rate of the DAQ, commonly chosen to be about half the sampling rate (500 Hz in this case).\n\nDAQ: This block represents the Data Acquisition system that samples the analog signal. It is configured to sample at a rate of 1000 samples per second. The DAQ digitizes the conditioned analog signal from the potentiometer for further processing or analysis.\n```",

        "content": "```Details\nLowPassFilter\n\nGiven the application context - a pendulum's angular position measurement - the frequency content of interest is generally low, since pendulum movements are typically slow compared to electronic signal dynamics. For this project, the key requirements for the low-pass filter (LPF) are to allow the pendulum's signal through while attenuating unwanted high-frequency noise, including 50 and 60 Hz interference from power lines and preventing aliasing due to the DAQ's sampling rate.\n\nTopology Suggestion:\nAn active second-order (or higher) Butterworth low-pass filter is recommended for this application, as it provides a maximally flat passband which is desirable for maintaining the fidelity of the angle measurement. The active design, using operational amplifiers, will offer better performance in terms of input and output impedance matching.\n\nCutoff Frequency:\nThe cutoff frequency should be chosen to be well below the Nyquist frequency of 500 Hz (half the DAQ's 1000 Hz sampling rate) to avoid aliasing. A reasonable cutoff frequency could be set around 100 Hz, which is high enough to capture the pendulum's dynamics without attenuation but low enough to attenuate any high-frequency noise.\n\nFilter Order:\nA second-order filter provides a 12 dB/octave roll-off which is often sufficient for many applications. However, if a sharper roll-off is required to better reject noise and prevent aliasing, a fourth-order filter (24 dB/octave) could be used.\n\nDamping Values:\nThe Butterworth filter inherently has a damping ratio (ζ) of 0.707 for a second-order filter, which ensures a maximally flat frequency response in the passband without any ripple.\n\nComponents:\n- Operational Amplifiers (e.g., LM358 or TL072 for low noise)\n- Resistors and Capacitors for setting the cutoff frequency and filter order\n\nThe specific values for resistors and capacitors in the filter would be calculated based on the chosen cutoff frequency and the operational amplifier's characteristics, using standard filter design equations. For a second-order Butterworth LPF with a 100 Hz cutoff frequency using a standard op-amp like the TL072, the component values could be approximately:\n- Resistors: R1 = R2 = 16 kΩ\n- Capacitors: C1 = C2 = 100 nF\n\nThese values provide a starting point that may need to be fine-tuned based on the actual behavior of the pendulum and the specific characteristics of the DAQ system. Simulation and prototyping would ideally be used to refine these values for the final design.\n```",

The Twin-T offers simplicity but is less stable compared to the Multiple Feedback design, which is more precise and allows for better control over the filter parameters.\n\nI will suggest a Multiple Feedback Notch Filter, as it provides better performance and stability which is important for accurate sensor readings.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Type: Active Notch Filter\n- Configuration: Multiple Feedback\n- Order: Second-order (this should be sufficient for narrow-bandwidth attenuation)\n- Center Frequencies: 50 Hz and 60 Hz (We may need two separate notch filters or one with a slightly wider notch to cover both frequencies)\n- Attenuation at Center Frequencies: At least -20 dB (This value should significantly reduce the noise without complex circuitry)\n- Quality Factor (Q): Between 10 and 30 (Higher Q for narrow bandwidth and greater attenuation)\n- Bandwidth: Defined by the Q factor (A higher Q results in a narrower bandwidth)\n\nComponents and Values:\n- Operational Amplifiers: Choose low-noise, precision op-amps like the LM358 or OP07 for better performance.\n- Resistors \u0026 Capacitors: Use 1% metal film resistors and film capacitors for better stability and lower tolerance.\n\nTo calculate the component values for each center frequency (f0), use the standard notch filter design equations:\n- f0 = 1 / (2 * π * √(R1*R2*C1*C2))\n- Q = √(R1/R2) / (2 * π * f0 * C1)\n\nFor a 50 Hz notch filter, assuming a Q of 10:\n- Choose C1 = C2 = 10 nF (arbitrary choice, C values typically chosen first in filter design)\n- Calculate R1 and R2 using the above equations to get the desired f0 and Q\n\nFor a 60 Hz notch filter, repeat the process with the respective frequency.\n\nThe two filters can be implemented separately or designed to have overlapping notches if a single filter with a wider notch is preferred.\n\nRanges to be filtered out:\n- Frequencies around 50 Hz and 60 Hz, with a notch width determined by the Q factor. The width should be narrow enough to avoid affecting the pendulum's signal frequencies but wide enough to account for possible variations in the noise frequencies.\n\nRanges to be kept in:\n- Frequencies outside the notch bandwidth, especially in the range of the pendulum's expected signal frequency (which is low and will likely be below 10 Hz), should not be affected by the filter.\n\nBy using these active notch filters, the DAQ will receive a cleaner signal from the potentiometer, with significant attenuation of the 50 Hz and 60 Hz interference, without the need to alter the DAQ's configuration or the input signal range.\n```",

The following specifications and topology suggestions are made:\n\n1. **Resolution**: For a pendulum angle measurement, a 12-bit ADC would likely provide sufficient resolution. This would give us 4096 distinct levels over the full range of the DAQ, which, for a voltage range of +/-7V, gives a theoretical resolution of approximately 3.4 mV per bit.\n\n2. **Sampling Rate**: The DAQ is capable of 1000 samples per second, so the ADC should match this rate to ensure no loss of data. This rate is more than sufficient for capturing the dynamics of a pendulum since its movements are relatively slow. \n\n3. **Input Voltage Range**: The ADC must be compatible with the input range of +/-7V. If the ADC chosen has a different input range, a scaling circuit might be necessary to match the input range of the ADC to that of the analog output from the signal conditioning circuit.\n\n4. **Input Impedance**: A high input impedance is preferred for the ADC to minimize loading effects on the signal conditioning circuitry. Typically, this would be in the megaohm range.\n\n5. **Anti-Aliasing Filter**: Since the DAQ cannot be altered, and assuming it does not have a built-in anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz (half the sampling rate), an external anti-aliasing filter must be implemented in the signal conditioning stage to prevent aliasing.\n\n6. **Type of ADC**: A successive approximation register (SAR) ADC topology would be suitable for this application due to its good balance between speed, accuracy, and cost.\n\n7. **Accuracy and Linearity**: The ADC should have good accuracy and linearity to ensure the angular measurements are reliable. The accuracy should be within a few least significant bits (LSBs) to avoid significant error in angle measurement.\n\n8. **Interface**: The ADC must have an interface compatible with the DAQ system. Typically, this would be a serial interface such as SPI or I2C, or parallel for higher data transfer rates if the DAQ supports it.\n\n9. **Power Supply**: The ADC must operate within the voltage supply available in the system, which should be considered during the signal conditioning design as well.\n\nConclusion: A 12-bit SAR ADC with a sampling rate of at least 1000 samples per second, high input impedance, serial or parallel interface, and an input voltage range that matches the conditioned signal should be used. An external anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency below 500 Hz will be included in the signal conditioning stage to prepare the analog signal for digitization by the ADC. The specific choice of ADC chip would need to be based on availability and compatibility with the rest of the system.\n```",

The actual resolution in degrees will also depend on the voltage span corresponding to the angle range. Since the potentiometer is linear, the resolution in degrees is even across the span.\n\nSensitivity: The sensitivity of the potentiometer is the change in output voltage per degree of rotation. Given the voltage range of -10V to +10V for an angle range of 45 to 135 degrees, the sensitivity is 20V / 90 degrees = 0.222V/degree.\n\nPower Rating: Potentiometers typically support low current levels, so the power rating is not expected to be a major constraint. A standard potentiometer can handle power levels around 0.5W to 1W which is sufficient for this low-current application.\n\nVoltage and Current Limits: The potentiometer's maximum voltage rating is well within the provided power source range of -10V to +10V. To protect the DAQ, ensure that the current through the potentiometer does not exceed the input current limits of the DAQ. This can be assured by the high resistance (10 kOhm) which limits the current to 1 mA at 10V.\n\nDurability: Continuous or frequent movement can wear down a potentiometer. The Bourns 3549 series has a rotational life of up to 10 million cycles, which should be adequate for most pendulum applications unless it's used in a highly rigorous industrial setting.\n\nTo summarize, the Bourns 3549 series conductive plastic potentiometer, with its 10 kOhm resistance, linear taper, and suitable temperature range, is a good fit for this project. It provides an adequate resolution for angle measurement, the sensitivity is appropriate for the voltage range, and its durability matches the expected use case.\n```",

Since the DAQ can handle a maximum of +/- 7 V and we know that 90 degrees corresponds to the steady position, we can infer that 90 degrees should correspond to 0 V output to the DAQ.\n\nGiven the linear relationship between the angle and voltage of the potentiometer and the requirement that 90 degrees corresponds to 0 V, we will center our output voltage swing around 0 V. The potentiometer provides a full scale of -10 V to +10 V, which corresponds to a 90-degree swing in both directions from the 90-degree steady state, so we need to scale this down to the DAQ's range of +/- 7 V to correspond to 45 degrees on either side of the steady state.\n\nA simple way to achieve this is to use a non-inverting summing amplifier configuration. The summing amplifier will allow us to add a DC offset to the signal and scale it to fit within the DAQ's input range.\n\nThe following components are suggested for the Offset Adjustment block:\n\n1. Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp): A precision rail-to-rail op-amp (for example, the ADA4077-2 from Analog Devices) that can operate with a single supply spanning the -10 V to +10 V range.\n2. Resistors: Precision resistors with a low temperature coefficient to ensure stability over varying temperatures. For instance, a 1% metal film resistor can be used.\n\nBelow is the proposed circuit topology for the Offset Adjustment block with example resistor values calculated for the desired voltage scaling:\n\n- V+: Connected to +10 V\n- V-: Connected to -10 V\n- R1: 10 kOhm (Input resistor)\n- R2: 14 kOhm (Feedback resistor)\n- R3: 14 kOhm (Grounding resistor for creating virtual ground at half-supply)\n- R4: 20 kOhm (Voltage divider resistor, paired with R5, to set appropriate offset)\n- R5: 20 kOhm (Voltage divider resistor, paired with R4)\n- RV1: 10 kOhm trim pot (Optional, for fine adjustment of offset)\n- Vout: Output to DAQ\n\nThe voltage divider created by R4 and R5 sets a reference voltage at half the supply voltage (0 V), which is the desired output for the steady state (90 degrees). The non-inverting input of the op-amp is connected to this reference voltage. The potentiometer's output is fed to the inverting input through R1. The feedback resistor R2, together with R1, sets the gain of the amplifier to scale the input voltage to fit within the DAQ's range. R3 ensures that the virtual ground is stable.\n\nIf manual adjustability for offset is required, RV1 can be included in series with R4 or R5 for fine-tuning. If not, the trim pot can be omitted, and fixed resistor values can be used.\n\nThis circuit will provide an adjustable voltage centered around 0 V, scaling the input from -10 V to +10 V to an output suitable for the DAQ's range of +/- 7 V, with 0 V corresponding to the 90-degree steady position of the pendulum.\n```",

Given the specified angle range of 45° to 135°, with 90° corresponding to the steady position and 0V output, the potentiometer will theoretically output a voltage range of -5V to 5V (assuming the center tap of the potentiometer produces 0V at 90° and the voltage scales linearly with angle).\n\nTo conform to the DAQ's maximum input voltage of ±7V and assuming the worst-case scenario where the output of the potentiometer swing is -5V to 5V, we will design the GainStage such that it does not amplify this signal beyond the DAQ's limit.\n\nHowever, to utilize the full dynamic range of the DAQ, the output voltage swing from the GainStage should be adjusted as close as possible to ±7V without exceeding it. Since the theoretical output voltage range of the potentiometer is -5V to 5V, a non-inverting amplifier topology can be used with an op-amp to achieve the necessary gain.\n\nGain calculation:\nVout_max / Vin_max = Gain\n±7V / ±5V = Gain\nGain = 1.4\n\nA non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 1.4 will amplify the -5V to 5V signal to -7V to 7V, which is within the DAQ's input voltage range. The gain is calculated as:\nGain = 1 + (Rf/Rin)\nChoosing Rin = 10kΩ, then Rf = 4kΩ.\n\nComponent selection and other considerations:\n- An operational amplifier with rail-to-rail output capability would be ideal to ensure the full voltage range is utilized.\n- The op-amp should have a low output impedance to drive the DAQ without distortion.\n- It should also have a low input bias current and low input offset voltage to minimize errors, especially important since the signal levels are relatively low.\n- Since frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz must be attenuated, the op-amp's frequency response should allow for the subsequent filter stages to perform effectively without introducing additional phase shifts or amplitude variations in that region.\n- It's assumed that the power supply for the op-amp can provide the necessary voltage levels and current for the chosen op-amp and expected load.\n\nWith these requirements, a suitable op-amp can be selected from a range of components that meet the specifications, such as the LM324 or TL084 for general-purpose applications, but the final choice may depend on factors such as cost, availability, and specific project constraints.\n```",

As the pendulum swings, it changes the resistance proportionally to its angle. The potentiometer converts the mechanical angle into a corresponding voltage signal. The range of -10V to 10V across the potentiometer is mapped to the angle range of 45 to 135 degrees, with 90 degrees corresponding to 0V.\n\nOffsetAdjustment: This block applies an offset voltage to the signal from the potentiometer to ensure that the steady position of 90 degrees corresponds to 0V. It also translates the -10V to +10V range to fit within the DAQ's input range of -7V to +7V. A simple op-amp circuit can be employed to add the required DC offset.\n\nGainStage: The GainStage is used to adjust the amplitude of the signal so that the entire dynamic range of the DAQ is utilized. This block will scale the potentiometer voltage, which spans the 45 to 135 degrees range, to fit within the DAQ's maximum voltage range. An operational amplifier configured for the appropriate gain can be used.\n\nLowPassFilter: This block is a low-pass filter that removes high-frequency noise above the desired signal bandwidth. Considering the sampling rate of the DAQ and the nature of the pendulum's movement, a cutoff frequency lower than half the sampling rate of the DAQ (Nyquist frequency) is chosen to prevent aliasing.\n\nNotchFilter: A notch filter is used to attenuate frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which are common noise frequencies due to electrical power lines. This filter is especially important for rejecting power line interference which could corrupt the measurement.\n\nAntiAliasingFilter: An anti-aliasing filter is implemented right before the DAQ to ensure that any high-frequency signal components that could cause aliasing are sufficiently attenuated. This is a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency set below the Nyquist rate of the DAQ, commonly chosen to be about half the sampling rate (500 Hz in this case).\n\nDAQ: This block represents the Data Acquisition system that samples the analog signal. It is configured to sample at a rate of 1000 samples per second. The DAQ digitizes the conditioned analog signal from the potentiometer for further processing or analysis.\n```"

        "content": "```Details\nLowPassFilter\n\nGiven the application context - a pendulum's angular position measurement - the frequency content of interest is generally low, since pendulum movements are typically slow compared to electronic signal dynamics. For this project, the key requirements for the low-pass filter (LPF) are to allow the pendulum's signal through while attenuating unwanted high-frequency noise, including 50 and 60 Hz interference from power lines and preventing aliasing due to the DAQ's sampling rate.\n\nTopology Suggestion:\nAn active second-order (or higher) Butterworth low-pass filter is recommended for this application, as it provides a maximally flat passband which is desirable for maintaining the fidelity of the angle measurement. The active design, using operational amplifiers, will offer better performance in terms of input and output impedance matching.\n\nCutoff Frequency:\nThe cutoff frequency should be chosen to be well below the Nyquist frequency of 500 Hz (half the DAQ's 1000 Hz sampling rate) to avoid aliasing. A reasonable cutoff frequency could be set around 100 Hz, which is high enough to capture the pendulum's dynamics without attenuation but low enough to attenuate any high-frequency noise.\n\nFilter Order:\nA second-order filter provides a 12 dB/octave roll-off which is often sufficient for many applications. However, if a sharper roll-off is required to better reject noise and prevent aliasing, a fourth-order filter (24 dB/octave) could be used.\n\nDamping Values:\nThe Butterworth filter inherently has a damping ratio (ζ) of 0.707 for a second-order filter, which ensures a maximally flat frequency response in the passband without any ripple.\n\nComponents:\n- Operational Amplifiers (e.g., LM358 or TL072 for low noise)\n- Resistors and Capacitors for setting the cutoff frequency and filter order\n\nThe specific values for resistors and capacitors in the filter would be calculated based on the chosen cutoff frequency and the operational amplifier's characteristics, using standard filter design equations. For a second-order Butterworth LPF with a 100 Hz cutoff frequency using a standard op-amp like the TL072, the component values could be approximately:\n- Resistors: R1 = R2 = 16 kΩ\n- Capacitors: C1 = C2 = 100 nF\n\nThese values provide a starting point that may need to be fine-tuned based on the actual behavior of the pendulum and the specific characteristics of the DAQ system. Simulation and prototyping would ideally be used to refine these values for the final design.\n```"

The Twin-T offers simplicity but is less stable compared to the Multiple Feedback design, which is more precise and allows for better control over the filter parameters.\n\nI will suggest a Multiple Feedback Notch Filter, as it provides better performance and stability which is important for accurate sensor readings.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Type: Active Notch Filter\n- Configuration: Multiple Feedback\n- Order: Second-order (this should be sufficient for narrow-bandwidth attenuation)\n- Center Frequencies: 50 Hz and 60 Hz (We may need two separate notch filters or one with a slightly wider notch to cover both frequencies)\n- Attenuation at Center Frequencies: At least -20 dB (This value should significantly reduce the noise without complex circuitry)\n- Quality Factor (Q): Between 10 and 30 (Higher Q for narrow bandwidth and greater attenuation)\n- Bandwidth: Defined by the Q factor (A higher Q results in a narrower bandwidth)\n\nComponents and Values:\n- Operational Amplifiers: Choose low-noise, precision op-amps like the LM358 or OP07 for better performance.\n- Resistors \u0026 Capacitors: Use 1% metal film resistors and film capacitors for better stability and lower tolerance.\n\nTo calculate the component values for each center frequency (f0), use the standard notch filter design equations:\n- f0 = 1 / (2 * π * √(R1*R2*C1*C2))\n- Q = √(R1/R2) / (2 * π * f0 * C1)\n\nFor a 50 Hz notch filter, assuming a Q of 10:\n- Choose C1 = C2 = 10 nF (arbitrary choice, C values typically chosen first in filter design)\n- Calculate R1 and R2 using the above equations to get the desired f0 and Q\n\nFor a 60 Hz notch filter, repeat the process with the respective frequency.\n\nThe two filters can be implemented separately or designed to have overlapping notches if a single filter with a wider notch is preferred.\n\nRanges to be filtered out:\n- Frequencies around 50 Hz and 60 Hz, with a notch width determined by the Q factor. The width should be narrow enough to avoid affecting the pendulum's signal frequencies but wide enough to account for possible variations in the noise frequencies.\n\nRanges to be kept in:\n- Frequencies outside the notch bandwidth, especially in the range of the pendulum's expected signal frequency (which is low and will likely be below 10 Hz), should not be affected by the filter.\n\nBy using these active notch filters, the DAQ will receive a cleaner signal from the potentiometer, with significant attenuation of the 50 Hz and 60 Hz interference, without the need to alter the DAQ's configuration or the input signal range.\n```"

The primary goal of the anti-aliasing filter is to prevent frequencies higher than half the sampling rate (500 Hz in this case) from being sampled, which can cause aliasing.\n\nTopology: Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Butterworth filters provide a maximally flat frequency response in the passband, which will preserve the shape of the pendulum's motion waveform without introducing ripple.\n\nOrder: Second-Order (2 poles)\n- A second-order filter provides a balance between complexity and performance. It has a roll-off rate of -12 dB/octave (or -40 dB/decade), which is generally sufficient to attenuate unwanted frequencies before reaching the Nyquist frequency.\n\nCutoff Frequency: 250 Hz\n- A cutoff frequency of 250 Hz is chosen because it is half the Nyquist frequency. This allows the filter to attenuate signals close to the Nyquist frequency while providing enough bandwidth for the pendulum's motion frequencies.\n\nComponents:\n- Operational Amplifier: A low-noise, rail-to-rail op-amp with a high slew rate to maintain signal fidelity.\n- Resistors \u0026 Capacitors: Precision resistors and capacitors with low temperature coefficients to ensure stable filter characteristics over temperature variations.\n\nDamping Factor (Q): 0.7071 (Critical Damping)\n- A damping factor of 0.7071 is characteristic of a Butterworth filter which ensures no resonance peak in the frequency response.\n\nAttenuation at Nyquist Frequency (500 Hz): At least -24 dB\n- Given that the roll-off rate is -12 dB/octave, the attenuation at 500 Hz (double the cutoff frequency) will be at least -24 dB, which is generally considered sufficient for preventing aliasing.\n\nWith this configuration, the filter will have a flat passband up to 250 Hz, ensuring accurate representation of the pendulum motion frequencies and attenuating high-frequency noise that could cause aliasing in the DAQ.\n\nRanges to be filtered out: Frequencies above 250 Hz will be progressively attenuated, with strong attenuation by 500 Hz to avoid aliasing in the sampled data.\n\nThis design is a good balance between simplicity and effectiveness for a wide range of applications. If in practice the system requires more aggressive attenuation near the Nyquist frequency, a higher order filter or an additional stage could be added.\n```"

The following specifications and topology suggestions are made:\n\n1. **Resolution**: For a pendulum angle measurement, a 12-bit ADC would likely provide sufficient resolution. This would give us 4096 distinct levels over the full range of the DAQ, which, for a voltage range of +/-7V, gives a theoretical resolution of approximately 3.4 mV per bit.\n\n2. **Sampling Rate**: The DAQ is capable of 1000 samples per second, so the ADC should match this rate to ensure no loss of data. This rate is more than sufficient for capturing the dynamics of a pendulum since its movements are relatively slow. \n\n3. **Input Voltage Range**: The ADC must be compatible with the input range of +/-7V. If the ADC chosen has a different input range, a scaling circuit might be necessary to match the input range of the ADC to that of the analog output from the signal conditioning circuit.\n\n4. **Input Impedance**: A high input impedance is preferred for the ADC to minimize loading effects on the signal conditioning circuitry. Typically, this would be in the megaohm range.\n\n5. **Anti-Aliasing Filter**: Since the DAQ cannot be altered, and assuming it does not have a built-in anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz (half the sampling rate), an external anti-aliasing filter must be implemented in the signal conditioning stage to prevent aliasing.\n\n6. **Type of ADC**: A successive approximation register (SAR) ADC topology would be suitable for this application due to its good balance between speed, accuracy, and cost.\n\n7. **Accuracy and Linearity**: The ADC should have good accuracy and linearity to ensure the angular measurements are reliable. The accuracy should be within a few least significant bits (LSBs) to avoid significant error in angle measurement.\n\n8. **Interface**: The ADC must have an interface compatible with the DAQ system. Typically, this would be a serial interface such as SPI or I2C, or parallel for higher data transfer rates if the DAQ supports it.\n\n9. **Power Supply**: The ADC must operate within the voltage supply available in the system, which should be considered during the signal conditioning design as well.\n\nConclusion: A 12-bit SAR ADC with a sampling rate of at least 1000 samples per second, high input impedance, serial or parallel interface, and an input voltage range that matches the conditioned signal should be used. An external anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency below 500 Hz will be included in the signal conditioning stage to prepare the analog signal for digitization by the ADC. The specific choice of ADC chip would need to be based on availability and compatibility with the rest of the system.\n```"

A suitable model could be the Bourns 3549 series.\n\nOperational Temperature Range: Assuming a general indoor environment, a temperature range of 0°C to 70°C should cover most situations. The Bourns 3549 series operates within this range.\n\nResolution: The resolution of the potentiometer is determined by its mechanical design and the voltage resolution of the DAQ. With a 10 kOhm potentiometer and a DAQ that can measure small voltage changes, the resolution should be sufficient for detecting minute changes in angle. The actual resolution in degrees will also depend on the voltage span corresponding to the angle range. Since the potentiometer is linear, the resolution in degrees is even across the span.\n\nSensitivity: The sensitivity of the potentiometer is the change in output voltage per degree of rotation. Given the voltage range of -10V to +10V for an angle range of 45 to 135 degrees, the sensitivity is 20V / 90 degrees = 0.222V/degree.\n\nPower Rating: Potentiometers typically support low current levels, so the power rating is not expected to be a major constraint. A standard potentiometer can handle power levels around 0.5W to 1W which is sufficient for this low-current application.\n\nVoltage and Current Limits: The potentiometer's maximum voltage rating is well within the provided power source range of -10V to +10V. To protect the DAQ, ensure that the current through the potentiometer does not exceed the input current limits of the DAQ. This can be assured by the high resistance (10 kOhm) which limits the current to 1 mA at 10V.\n\nDurability: Continuous or frequent movement can wear down a potentiometer. The Bourns 3549 series has a rotational life of up to 10 million cycles, which should be adequate for most pendulum applications unless it's used in a highly rigorous industrial setting.\n\nTo summarize, the Bourns 3549 series conductive plastic potentiometer, with its 10 kOhm resistance, linear taper, and suitable temperature range, is a good fit for this project. It provides an adequate resolution for angle measurement, the sensitivity is appropriate for the voltage range, and its durability matches the expected use case.\n```"

Since the DAQ can handle a maximum of +/- 7 V and we know that 90 degrees corresponds to the steady position, we can infer that 90 degrees should correspond to 0 V output to the DAQ.\n\nGiven the linear relationship between the angle and voltage of the potentiometer and the requirement that 90 degrees corresponds to 0 V, we will center our output voltage swing around 0 V. The potentiometer provides a full scale of -10 V to +10 V, which corresponds to a 90-degree swing in both directions from the 90-degree steady state, so we need to scale this down to the DAQ's range of +/- 7 V to correspond to 45 degrees on either side of the steady state.\n\nA simple way to achieve this is to use a non-inverting summing amplifier configuration. The summing amplifier will allow us to add a DC offset to the signal and scale it to fit within the DAQ's input range.\n\nThe following components are suggested for the Offset Adjustment block:\n\n1. Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp): A precision rail-to-rail op-amp (for example, the ADA4077-2 from Analog Devices) that can operate with a single supply spanning the -10 V to +10 V range.\n2. Resistors: Precision resistors with a low temperature coefficient to ensure stability over varying temperatures. For instance, a 1% metal film resistor can be used.\n\nBelow is the proposed circuit topology for the Offset Adjustment block with example resistor values calculated for the desired voltage scaling:\n\n- V+: Connected to +10 V\n- V-: Connected to -10 V\n- R1: 10 kOhm (Input resistor)\n- R2: 14 kOhm (Feedback resistor)\n- R3: 14 kOhm (Grounding resistor for creating virtual ground at half-supply)\n- R4: 20 kOhm (Voltage divider resistor, paired with R5, to set appropriate offset)\n- R5: 20 kOhm (Voltage divider resistor, paired with R4)\n- RV1: 10 kOhm trim pot (Optional, for fine adjustment of offset)\n- Vout: Output to DAQ\n\nThe voltage divider created by R4 and R5 sets a reference voltage at half the supply voltage (0 V), which is the desired output for the steady state (90 degrees). The non-inverting input of the op-amp is connected to this reference voltage. The potentiometer's output is fed to the inverting input through R1. The feedback resistor R2, together with R1, sets the gain of the amplifier to scale the input voltage to fit within the DAQ's range. R3 ensures that the virtual ground is stable.\n\nIf manual adjustability for offset is required, RV1 can be included in series with R4 or R5 for fine-tuning. If not, the trim pot can be omitted, and fixed resistor values can be used.\n\nThis circuit will provide an adjustable voltage centered around 0 V, scaling the input from -10 V to +10 V to an output suitable for the DAQ's range of +/- 7 V, with 0 V corresponding to the 90-degree steady position of the pendulum.\n```"
