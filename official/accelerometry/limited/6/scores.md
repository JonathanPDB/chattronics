Explanations: 
The project summary provided details on the design and components of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device. However, not all the requirements are explicitly mentioned or can be inferred from the provided information. Here is the analysis based on the requirements:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) are given as 620 MΩ and 1 pF, respectively. The product Rf*Cf = 620*10^6 * 1*10^-12 = 620*10^-6 s. This is not close to 2/pi (approximately 0.637), and there is no mention of a 10% tolerance being considered. Requirement not met.

2. The gain of the amplifier is given as 100 (non-inverting configuration with R1 = 1 kΩ and R2 = 100 kΩ), Cf is 1 pF, but the value of G x 1.61p / Cf is not provided, nor can it be calculated without knowing the specific gain of the charge amplifier (not the overall amplifier). Requirement not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output calculated by the design is 5 pC, which does not match the required 161 pC. Requirement not met.

4. The bias current is not explicitly provided in the project summary. Requirement not met.

5. The project summary does not provide a value for the bias current, nor does it mention that 0.01/Rf equals the bias current. Requirement not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the signal from a piezoelectric sensor. Requirement met.

7. The design is optimized for low-frequency measurements and mentions a low-frequency cutoff at 0.25 Hz, which is close to the required 2 Hz input oscillation, but there are no explicit calculations backing up the optimization for 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude. Requirement not met.

8. The charge amplifier output voltage is designed to be 1 V peak-to-peak based on the chosen Cf and the theoretical calculations. Requirement met.

9. The offset voltage is not mentioned, therefore it cannot be determined if it is kept below 10 mV. Requirement not met.

Based on the information provided, only 2 out of the 9 requirements are met.
