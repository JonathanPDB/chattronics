Score: 8
Explanations: 
The project summary covers the following requirements:

1. The output is being measured by a multimeter. This requirement is implicitly covered as the output voltage suitable for measurement with a multimeter is mentioned.
2. There is an amplification stage, and the gain is provided and justified. The gain calculation is explained with a desired 0-20 V output range from an input range of 0-100 mV, resulting in a gain of 200.
3. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is between 0 and 20 Volts. This is explicitly stated as the desired output range.
4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC. The parallel resistor for linearization is chosen to match the thermistor's resistance at 50°C.
5. The NTC is linearized. This is confirmed by the inclusion of a parallel resistor for linearization.
6. The architecture consists of the sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering, and measurement. This is outlined in the project overview.
7. The sensor used is an NTC thermistor. This is explicitly stated with the model number Vishay NTCLE100E3.
8. The self-heating effect is taken into account. The requirement that the self-heating effect must be maintained below 1% indicates that the maximum current through the NTC is known and managed.

All of the listed requirements are met by the project summary provided.
