Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project description provided for the analog instrumentation design for a pressure and temperature monitoring system is quite detailed and addresses many of the requirements specified. The following points address each requirement individually:

1. Both sensors have d.c. output, as specified by the output characteristics of the Honeywell Trustability HSC Series pressure sensor and the infrared radiation detectors like MLX90614 by Melexis or OS-MINIUSB by Omega.
2. Both sensors are amplified, with specified gains for the pressure (Gp) and temperature sensors (Gt) using instrumentation amplifiers.
3. The pressure sensor is to be inserted in a Wheatstone bridge and amplified by a suitable instrumentation amplifier, meeting this requirement.
4. An ADC is used with a resolution of 12 bits or higher and a sampling rate of ≥2500 samples per second per channel.
5. Temperature linearization is addressed through digital linearization using a microcontroller or analog circuit.
6. The project description does not explicitly mention the sampling order strategy (sequential, simultaneous, etc.), which is a missing detail.
7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is ≥2500 samples per second per channel, which exceeds the minimum requirement of 800 Hz.
8. The anti-aliasing filter is a 4th-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz. However, the description does not specify the gain at half the sampling frequency, which is required to be at least -20 dB.
9. The cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter is 500 Hz, which is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency, as long as the sampling frequency per channel does not exceed 5000 samples per second.
10. The anti-aliasing filter is mentioned, which would be positioned before the multiplexer(s) to reduce aliasing.
11. The project uses a 16-to-1 analog multiplexer, meeting the requirement for channel selection.
12. The multiplexer specified (CD4051B or similar) is a CMOS analog multiplexer, which is a solid-state device.

While most of the requirements are met, there are a couple of points that need clarification or additional information:
- The sampling order strategy is not mentioned, which is necessary for assessing the sampling methodology.
- The gain of the anti-aliasing filter at half the sampling frequency is not specified, which is required to ensure proper attenuation of the signal to avoid aliasing.

Therefore, due to the missing details regarding the sampling strategy and the anti-aliasing filter specification, the project can be categorized as "acceptable" since these issues do not render the project unfeasible or conceptually incorrect but do prevent it from being "optimal."
