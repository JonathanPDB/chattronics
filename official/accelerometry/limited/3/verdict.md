Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project presents a design for a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device utilizing a piezoelectric accelerometer and a charge amplifier, among other components. However, the project details do not fully satisfy the requirements set for the charge amplifier design.

1. The calculated feedback capacitance (Cf) of 12.8 pF does not comply with the requirement that the feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance must be roughly around 2/pi. The feedback resistance is not provided, thus we cannot verify this requirement.

2. The gain (G) of the charge amplifier is stated to be 78.125 MV/pC. Using the given formula (G x 1.61p / Cf), the result would be (78.125 MV/pC x 1.61E-12) / 12.8E-12 = 9.78, which is significantly higher than the requirement of being roughly around 1 with only a 10% tolerance.

3. The project mentions an expected peak charge of 6.4 pC, which is not in line with the requirement of having a peak-to-peak charge output of around 161 pC.

4. The bias current is not directly provided; the only mention related to biasing is the selection of an op-amp with a low input bias current (< 1 nA), which does not fulfill the requirement to provide the bias current explicitly.

5. Since the feedback resistance value is not provided, the calculation of 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance to equal the bias current cannot be verified.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, fulfilling this requirement.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, and calculations are provided for some parameters. However, the expected peak charge calculated does not match the requirement, raising questions about the optimization accuracy.

8. The desired peak-to-peak voltage output of 1 V is in line with the requirement.

9. Offset compensation is mentioned, with a maximum offset voltage below 10 mV, fulfilling this requirement.

Given the discrepancies in essential requirements, particularly the charge amplifier gain and peak charge output, the project cannot be categorized as "optimal" or "acceptable". Moreover, although the project is theoretically correct in some aspects, the significant deviations from the requirements make it unviable as presented. Therefore, the project is categorized as "unfeasible".
