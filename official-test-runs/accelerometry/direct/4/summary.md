Design of a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Architecture Overview:
The proposed device comprises several key blocks: the piezoelectric accelerometer, charge amplifier, low-pass filter, anti-aliasing filter, analog-to-digital converter (ADC), digital signal processing (DSP) block, and output interface. The architecture ensures accurate measurement of low-frequency vibrations and provides both analog and digital outputs suitable for various applications.

Accelerometer:
- Sensitivity: 100 pC/g
- Model suggestion: PCB Piezotronics 352C33 or similar
- Expected peak acceleration: 0.0201 g (calculated from a peak oscillation of 5 cm at 2 Hz)
- Operating temperature range and protective casing should be considered based on the environment of use.

Charge Amplifier:
- Topology: Integrating charge amplifier using an operational amplifier (op-amp)
- Feedback Capacitor (C_f): Selected value of 10.1 pF for standard component availability
- Feedback Resistor (R_f): 64 MΩ as a standard value close to the calculated 63.66 MΩ, to achieve the desired low frequency cutoff
- Gain (A_v): Approximately 155.3 V/C, adjusted due to standard component values
- Op-Amp selection: Precision FET input op-amp with low offset voltage, such as the ADA4530-1 or LMC6001

Low-Pass Filter:
- Topology: Active second-order Butterworth low-pass filter using an op-amp
- Cutoff Frequency (f_c): 0.25 Hz
- Component values: Capacitors (C1 = C2 = 68 μF, scaled from a standard 1 kHz design), Resistors (R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ)
- Op-Amp selection: Low offset voltage, low noise op-amp (e.g., AD8656)

Anti-Aliasing Filter:
- Topology: Second-order Sallen-Key low-pass Butterworth filter
- Chosen Cutoff Frequency (fc): 10 Hz, based on an assumed ADC sampling rate of at least 40 Hz
- Component Values: Capacitors (C1 = C2 = 160 nF), Resistors (R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ)
- Op-Amp selection: Low noise, low offset operational amplifier (e.g., AD8656)

ADC:
- Type: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) 12-bit ADC
- Sampling Rate: At least 10 S/s, chosen sampling rate of 40 Hz for a margin above Nyquist
- Input: Differential input for improved noise immunity
- Interface: SPI or I2C for communication with the DSP block

Signal Processing:
- Microcontroller: ARM Cortex-M4 or M7 series for low power consumption and DSP instructions
- Functions: Data acquisition, digital filtering, feature extraction (e.g., RMS, FFT), output formatting
- Power Management: Low-power design techniques and sleep modes for battery operation
- Interface: Onboard non-volatile memory for data logging, digital display, and user interface (e.g., LCD or OLED)

Output:
- Analog Output: Operational amplifier buffer to scale the signal to standard levels (e.g., 0-5V or 0-10V)
- Digital Output: Communication protocols managed by the microcontroller (e.g., I2C, SPI, Bluetooth)
- Display: LCD or OLED for real-time data visualization
- Data Storage: SD card slot for data logging

The design considerations include ensuring power efficiency for portability, selecting standard value components for practicality, and calibrating the gain and offset for accuracy. The device architecture caters to both analog and digital output use cases, with considerations for interfacing, user interaction, and environmental conditions.
