Design and Architecture for a Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

The proposed design is a portable device for measuring low-frequency vibrations using a piezoelectric accelerometer. The device comprises several blocks including the sensor, signal conditioning (charge amplifier, low-pass filter, and gain stage), buffer, ADC, and output stage.

Piezoelectric Accelerometer:
- Recommended Model: PCB Piezotronics model 352C33 or equivalent charge mode accelerometer with a sensitivity of approximately 100 pC/g.
- Expected Low-Frequency Response: 3 dB down at 0.25 Hz for the system.

Charge Amplifier:
- Calculated for a maximum expected charge Q_max of 5000 pC (assuming 100 pC/g sensitivity and a reasonable maximum acceleration of 50g).
- Desired output voltage of 1 Vpp.
- Gain (G) = V_out / Q_max = 0.2 mV/pC.
- Feedback Capacitor (C_f): 82 nF (chosen near calculated 79.58 nF for standard value).
- Feedback Resistor (R_f): 200 kΩ (chosen near calculated 193.4 kΩ for standard value).

Low-Pass Filter:
- Second-Order Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter Configuration.
- Cutoff frequency: 2 Hz.
- Resistor (R) for cutoff frequency: 82 kΩ (chosen near calculated 79.6 kΩ for standard value).
- Capacitor (C) for cutoff frequency: 1 uF.

Gain Stage:
- Non-Inverting Amplifier Configuration.
- Estimated Gain: 100 (assuming 10 mVpp output from charge amplifier).
- Resistance (Rf): 99 kΩ.
- Resistance (Ri): 1 kΩ.

Buffer:
- Unity Gain Operational Amplifier Configuration.
- Suggested Op-Amp: ADA4528-1 or OPA227.
- Bandwidth Requirement: Minimum 20 Hz (to cover 2 Hz signal with adequate margin).
- Power Supply: Assumed to be either single 5V or dual ±5V.

Analog to Digital Converter (ADC):
- Suggested ADC Type: SAR ADC.
- Assumed Resolution: 16-bit for high precision.
- Suggested Sampling Rate: 20 samples per second (20 Hz).
- Assumed Input Voltage Range: ±5 V or ±10 V.
- Suggested Additional Features: Integrated anti-aliasing filter, on-chip buffer.
- Power Supply: Assumed to be compatible with 3.3 V or 5 V power systems.

Output:
- Analog Voltage Output: Provided by the buffer if ADC is not used.
- Digital Interface: If required, use standard communication protocols (I2C, SPI, USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
- Isolated Output: Implemented if necessary for safety or noise reduction.
- Power Management: Include low-power modes and power-efficient design considerations.

This high-level design provides a robust solution for a portable device to measure low-frequency vibrations with components selected based on industry-standard values and typical application requirements. Adjustments to the design may be necessary based on further details regarding the operating environment, power supply specifications, and interfacing requirements.
