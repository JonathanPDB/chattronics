Industrial Machine Monitoring System Design

Pressure Sensor Array:
- Model: Honeywell FSG series or similar strain-gauge based sensors.
- Pressure range: 0 to 10 bar (general industrial range, can be adjusted based on requirements).
- Operating temperature range: -40°C to 85°C (standard industrial grade).
- Sensitivity and resolution: 0.1% of the full scale for 1% accuracy.
- Environmental conditions: Robust construction to handle vibration, shock, and chemical exposure.
- Power supply voltage: Typically 24V in industrial environments.

Temperature Sensor Array:
- Infrared radiation detectors for surface temperature.
- Temperature range: Select sensors with a broad range, e.g., -40°C to +200°C.
- Resolution: 0.1°C for accurate measurement.
- Factory calibration with options for field recalibration.
- Linear phase response preferred for transient signals.

Pressure Amplifiers:
- Gain requirement: 5000 or 2500 (to be confirmed based on ADC input range).
- Topology: Instrumentation Amplifier, suggested op-amps: AD620 or INA114.
- Power supply: Dual ±15V or single +24V (typical for industrial settings).
- Output: Differential recommended for better noise immunity.

Temperature Linearization:
- Approaches: Lookup Table with a microcontroller, analog linearization circuit, or polynomial linearization.
- Op-amp for scaling output: Suggested AD8605 or OPAx2337.
- Power supply: Typically dual ±5V or single +5V.

Temperature Amplifiers:
- Gain: Unity Gain (if the ADC input range is confirmed to be 100 mV) or more if the ADC range is higher.
- Topology: Non-inverting operational amplifier.
- Op-amp: Low-noise, precision, rail-to-rail output (e.g., AD8605 or OPAx2337).

Anti-Aliasing Filters:
- Filter type: Second-order Butterworth low-pass filter.
- Cutoff frequency: 400 Hz.
- Filter topology: Sallen-Key or Multiple Feedback (MFB).
- Op-amp: Low-noise, rail-to-rail capable of operating at 800 Hz and above.

ADCs:
- Resolution: At least 10-bit, 12-bit recommended.
- Sampling rate: Minimum of 1 kHz per channel.
- ADC Topology: SAR ADCs with integrated multiplexer preferred.
- Example ADCs: ADS7886 from Texas Instruments or MAX11131 from Maxim Integrated.

Multiplexer:
- Data rate: High enough to handle the combined data streams from all sensors.
- Communication protocols: Support for common interfaces like SPI and I2C.
- Resolution: Matches or exceeds that of the ADCs (at least 10-bit).
- Synchronization: Support for frame clock or data valid signal for data integrity.
- Buffering capabilities: To prevent data loss during high throughput or processing delays.

Overall, the system should be designed with flexibility and adaptability to different power supplies, communication interfaces, and environmental conditions. All components should be selected based on industrial-grade specifications to ensure reliability and durability in harsh environments.
