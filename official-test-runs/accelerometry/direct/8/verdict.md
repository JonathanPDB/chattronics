Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project description provides a comprehensive architecture of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device, with the charge amplifier being a critical component within the system. However, not all required information for a full review is provided. Critical details regarding the feedback resistance and capacitance of the charge amplifier, the bias current, and the offset voltage are missing. Here is an assessment based on the available information:

1. The requirement for the feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance to be around 2/pi with a 10% variance is not mentioned in the project description. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether this requirement is met.
2. The charge amplifier gain is provided as 1.96x10^12 V/C, but the feedback capacitance (Cf) is not specified, hence it's not possible to verify if the gain multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by Cf is around 1 with a 10% variance.
3. The peak-to-peak charge output of 161 pC is not specifically addressed in the provided summary.
4. The bias current provision is not detailed.
5. There is no information provided to verify if 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance equals the bias current.
6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which aligns with the requirements.
7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, as indicated by the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter, which suggests that calculations may back this up, but the specific calculations for 5 cm amplitude are not provided.
8. The output voltage is specified as 1 V peak-to-peak, which meets the requirement.
9. The offset voltage is specified for the buffer stage to be below 1 mV, but it is not clear if this applies to the entire system, including the charge amplifier, to keep it below 10 mV.

Without the full details, it's challenging to categorize the project accurately, but based on the information provided, there are indications that some requirements may not be fully met or verified.
