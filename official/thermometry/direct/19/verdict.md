Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project description covers the necessary stages: sensor (NTC), linearization, amplification, level shifting, buffering, and output measurement. However, there are a few points to address:

1. The linearization of the NTC with a parallel resistor is mentioned, which is a common method for improving the linearity of the NTC response. The resistor value is chosen based on the resistance of the NTC at 50°C, which is appropriate for optimizing for the midrange temperature. This meets requirement 4.

2. The NTC thermistor is indeed used as the sensing element, fulfilling requirement 7.

3. The self-heating effect is acknowledged, and a maximum current through the NTC thermistor is considered, which satisfies requirement 8.

4. The amplification stage is designed to achieve the required 0-20V output range from a 0.5V to 2.5V input signal, providing a gain of 10. While the gain is specified, the justification for the input voltage range (0.5V to 2.5V) is unclear, considering the linearization stage is expected to output around 2.5V at the midpoint temperature (50°C). The output voltage range (0-20V) is within the multimeter's measurement capabilities, which is in line with requirement 3.

5. There is no explicit mention of an optional filtering stage, which could be important for noise reduction, but it is not a critical omission for the basic functionality of the system.

6. The architecture is roughly as required, with the sensor, linearization stage, amplification, and measurement included. A level shifting stage and a buffer stage are also included, which are not strictly necessary but can be beneficial for certain applications.

7. The project does not provide detailed calculations or specific design considerations for the actual construction and testing of the system, such as PCB layout, component tolerances, temperature drift, or the effects of supply voltage variations on the accuracy of the system. However, these are considerations for a more advanced design review and do not necessarily detract from the fundamental design concept presented.

The project seems to be well-conceived with respect to the basic requirements, but it lacks some specificity in the amplification stage justification and detailed design considerations for practical implementation. Hence, it is categorized as "acceptable."
