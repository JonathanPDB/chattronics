So, sensitivity is 10V over a 90-degree range, resulting in 0.2222V/degree.\n- Anti-Aliasing Filter Cutoff Frequency: With a desired cutoff frequency (fc) of 50 Hz and choosing a resistor value (R) of 3.2 kOhms, capacitor (C) value is calculated using fc = 1 / (2 * π * √(R * C)), leading to C ≈ 1 uF.\n\nAll component values and configurations are given based on standard values and typical requirements for such a measurement system. The exact values should be fine-tuned based on the final environment, DAQ input characteristics, and component availability."

    "response": "```explanations\nThe summary presents a comprehensive design for a pendulum angle measurement system. Here's how it aligns with the project requirements:\n\n1. The potentiometer is appropriately used as a voltage divider.\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V, which is within the specified range.\n3. The architecture includes a voltage divider (with a voltage buffer), an anti-aliasing filter, and a DAQ system to measure the voltage, which is simple and adheres to the requirements.\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ is configurable to +/- 7V, which is centered at 0V as required.\n5. The DAQ's input voltage range is correctly limited to a maximum of 7V, meeting the essential requirement.\n6. An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz is included to avoid aliasing, though this might be too low given the potentiometer's sensitivity and the expected signal frequency.\n7. A band-stop filter is implemented to remove frequencies around 50 to 60 Hz, satisfying this requirement.\n8. The anti-aliasing filter is a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz, which may not achieve the required -20 dB at 500 Hz, as the cutoff frequency is much lower than 500 Hz. This could be an issue because the attenuation at 500 Hz might not be sufficient to meet the stated requirement.\n\nWhile most requirements are met, there is a concern with the cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter. It is designed with a 50 Hz cutoff, which may not attenuate the signal sufficiently by -20 dB at 500 Hz. This could potentially allow higher frequency components to alias into the signal band of interest, which is a critical aspect to consider for accurate measurements. The design would be improved by selecting a higher cutoff frequency for the anti-aliasing filter that satisfies the attenuation requirement at 500 Hz.\n\nAdditionally, while the band-stop filter effectively attenuates 50 and 60 Hz, it is not explicitly mentioned if it meets the -20 dB gain requirement at 500 Hz. This may or may not be an issue depending on the specific design of the band-stop filter and the overall filter chain's response.\n\nOverall, the design is close to meeting all requirements, but due to the potential issue with the anti-aliasing filter not attenuating enough at 500 Hz, the verdict is \"acceptable\" rather than \"optimal.\"\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
