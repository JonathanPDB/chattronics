Pendulum Angle Measurement System Design

This summary consolidates the detailed analog electronic design for a pendulum angle measurement system utilizing a potentiometer, signal conditioning circuits, and a DAQ system.

1. Potentiometer:
   - Type: Linear potentiometer
   - Value: 10 kOhms
   - Operating Voltage: -10V to +10V
   - Power Rating: 0.5W (assuming a maximum power dissipation of 0.04 Watts)
   - Operating Temperature Range: -10°C to 70°C
   - Durability: Commercial-grade with ~100,000 rotational cycles
   - Linearity Tolerance: ±0.5%
   - Suggested Model: Bourns 3590S-2-103L 10K Ohm Potentiometer

2. Buffer (Voltage Follower):
   - Op-Amp: General-purpose precision op-amp such as the OPA134 series or AD860x series
   - Configuration: Non-inverting voltage follower
   - Power Supply: ±10V
   - Bandwidth: >1 MHz
   - Temperature Coefficient: Typical tempco around 5 μV/°C or better
   - Noise Figure: 5 to 10 nV/√Hz
   - Decoupling Capacitors: 0.1 μF ceramic capacitors near the op-amp power supply pins

3. Amplifier (Differential or Gain Stage):
   - Gain: 1.4 (to scale the potentiometer's output range to the DAQ's input range)
   - Resistor Values: R1 (feedback resistor) = 40 kOhms, R2 (grounded resistor) = 100 kOhms
   - Op-Amp: General-purpose op-amp like the LM358
   - Power Supply: Single supply of +10V

4. Filter_50Hz (Notch Filter):
   - Topology: Active Twin-T or Multiple Feedback Topology
   - Notch Frequency: 50 Hz
   - Quality Factor (Q): 10 to 30
   - Attenuation: At least 20 dB at 50 Hz
   - Op-Amp: Low-noise op-amp with sufficient bandwidth (e.g., TL072)
   - Components: Precision resistors (1% tolerance) and capacitors (5% tolerance)

5. Filter_60Hz (Notch Filter):
   - Similar to the Filter_50Hz block with a notch frequency set at 60 Hz

6. Anti-Aliasing Filter (Low-Pass Filter):
   - Topology: Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter
   - Order: 2nd-order
   - Cutoff Frequency: 450 Hz (to prevent aliasing and provide a buffer above the Nyquist frequency)
   - Op-Amp: General-purpose Op-Amp with a GBWP significantly higher than 450 Hz, such as TL072
   - Passive Components: Metal film resistors with 1% tolerance and ceramic or film capacitors with 5% tolerance

7. Data Acquisition System (DAQ):
   - Sampling Rate: 1000 samples per second
   - Resolution: Assuming 12-bit or 16-bit ADC for precision
   - Input Voltage Range: Matches the output voltage range of +/-7V from the signal conditioning stages
   - Anti-Aliasing Filter: Integrated or external, with a cutoff frequency slightly above the highest frequency of interest

Design Considerations:
- The system architecture is designed to ensure that the potentiometer's signal is buffered without loading, amplified, and filtered to remove noise at 50 Hz and 60 Hz, and finally conditioned to avoid aliasing before being sampled by the DAQ.
- The selection of components and topology for each block is based on providing a balance between simplicity, performance, and robustness given the lack of specific constraints provided by the user.
- The actual values of the components used in the filters depend on the op-amp characteristics and will require additional calculation or adjustment based on the specific op-amp chosen for the final design.
- The amplifier gain, filter Q factors, and anti-aliasing filter cutoff will require fine-tuning during the testing and calibration phase to ensure optimal performance.
