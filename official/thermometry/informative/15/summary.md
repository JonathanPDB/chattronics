ANALOG TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The project aims to measure the temperature of water in a beaker using an NTC thermistor and output a corresponding voltage in the range of 0-20V for measurement by a multimeter. The solution consists of several stages of signal conditioning and processing to ensure an accurate and linear voltage output.

NTC Thermistor:
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3, with the assumption of typical values such as 10kΩ resistance at 25°C and a beta value of 3950K, which is common for NTC thermistors.
- Temperature Range: 10°C to 90°C.

Linearization Network:
- The parallel resistor is used to linearize the response of the thermistor around the midpoint temperature of 50°C.
- The resistance of the thermistor at 50°C (R50) is estimated using the standard Steinhart-Hart equation or beta formula.
- The parallel resistor value (Rp) is approximated to be close to R50, with the exact value to be fine-tuned during calibration.

Buffer:
- An op-amp in a voltage follower configuration is used as a buffer to prevent loading the linearization network.
- The chosen op-amp has high input impedance (>10 MΩ) and low noise characteristics.
- Example op-amp: OPA132 series or similar with FET inputs.

Gain Stage:
- Non-inverting op-amp configuration is used to set a variable gain to scale the output voltage range.
- Gain is initially set to 10, assuming a 1V change at the input results in a 10V change at the output.
- A potentiometer is included for adjustable gain, which will be calibrated to achieve the full 0-20V output response corresponding to the temperature range.
- Example op-amp: AD8628 or OPA177.

Level Shifter:
- Not required if the Gain Stage already provides the 0-20V output range.
- If needed, an op-amp configured as a summing amplifier could be used to add an offset voltage to the signal.

Anti-Aliasing Filter:
- An active low-pass filter with a Butterworth response is chosen to avoid distortion within the frequency range of interest.
- The cutoff frequency is initially set to 10 Hz to filter out high-frequency noise.
- A 2nd-order Sallen-Key topology is used with 10 kΩ resistors and 1.59 µF capacitors.
- Example op-amp: LM358.

Overall, the system is designed to be robust and flexible with adjustable parameters for calibration. Precision components with low temperature coefficients and tight tolerances are chosen to ensure stability and accuracy. The design takes into account the need for a high impedance buffer and scalable gain to match the output requirements of a standard multimeter with a 0-20V range.
