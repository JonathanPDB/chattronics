1. Both sensors have d.c. output, so no demodulation should be used.
2. An ADC should be used
3. Radiation sensors are being linearized
4. Radiation sensors are being linearized either digitally in the computer or by using diode networks or log amplifiers.
5. The solution mentions the sampling order strategy, if it'll be sequential, simultaneously, etc
6. The sampling frequency is not less than 1000 Hz
7. The sampling frequency is higher than 2000 Hz
8. The solution implements a low pass filters
9. The low pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the sampling frequency.
10. Anti-aliasing is placed before multiplexers
11. The project uses multiplexers to choose channels
12. The multiplexers are solid state
