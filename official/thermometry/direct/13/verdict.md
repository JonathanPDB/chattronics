Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project description covers the key requirements for an analog temperature measurement system using an NTC thermistor. The use of a Vishay NTCLE100E3 series thermistor aligns with requirement 7. The linearization of the NTC thermistor using a parallel resistor optimized for 50°C is in line with requirement 4, and the mention of self-heating and the need to keep the operating current low addresses requirement 8.

The amplification stages are well described, with a buffer amplifier and a signal conditioning amplifier, meeting requirement 2. The output voltage range of 0 to 20V is suitable for measurement by a multimeter, fulfilling requirement 3. The system architecture follows the sensor, linearization stage, amplification, and measurement sequence, which aligns with requirement 6.

The gain of the amplifiers is provided and justified based on the expected voltage ranges, which is a critical aspect of the design. Additional considerations such as waterproofing, decoupling capacitors, and calibration mechanisms indicate a thorough consideration for practical implementation.

However, the description lacks specific details on the actual implementation of the linearization network and how well it linearizes the NTC's response throughout the entire temperature range, not just at 50°C. It is also not clear whether the linearization has been tested and verified to be "absolutely necessary and fatal if false," as per requirement 5. Additionally, the exact value of the maximum current through the NTC is not provided, which is necessary to fully evaluate the management of the self-heating effect.

The project description also assumes the use of specific op-amp models without detailed justification for each choice based on their electrical characteristics, which could be important for the performance of the overall system. While the selection is likely suitable, it would be beneficial to see a more detailed rationale.

Given the information provided, the project seems theoretically sound and potentially implementable, but lacks detailed validation of the linearization and a complete explanation of the op-amp selection process. Therefore, the verdict is "acceptable" since there are no fatal issues detected but some areas could be further detailed or validated to ensure optimal performance.
