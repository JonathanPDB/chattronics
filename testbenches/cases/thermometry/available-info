1. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter should be between 0 and 20 Volts.
2. The temperatures that will be measured are between 10 and 90 degrees celsius.
3. The self heating effect must be considered and therefore the current must be limited.
4. There should be no ADC.
5. The sensor to be used is a NTC.
6. The NTC must be linearized for the midpoint of the input range by a resistor in parallel
