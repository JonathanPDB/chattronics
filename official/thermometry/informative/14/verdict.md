Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project overview describes a water temperature measurement system using an NTC thermistor with a linearization network, buffer amplifier, and scaling amplifier to provide a 0-20V output corresponding to a 10°C to 90°C temperature range. This output is measured by a multimeter. The NTC thermistor and the linearization process are core to the project, and the self-heating effect is implicitly considered through the use of a buffer amplifier which minimizes current draw from the thermistor.

The following aspects of the project are reviewed based on the requirements:

1. The output is measured by a multimeter, which is in line with the requirements.
2. There is an amplification stage with a scaling amplifier gain of 20, which is justified to scale the maximum expected voltage to the full 0-20V range of the multimeter.
3. The output voltage range of 0-20V is appropriate for measurement by the multimeter.
4. Linearization of the NTC is mentioned with a parallel resistor optimized for the midrange temperature of 50°C.
5. The NTC is stated to be linearized, which is a critical requirement.
6. The architecture includes the sensor, linearization stage, amplification, and measurement, which fits the rough architecture required.
7. An NTC thermistor is used as the sensor, which is a critical requirement.
8. The self-heating effect seems to be accounted for through the buffer amplifier, but the maximum current through the NTC is not explicitly mentioned.

However, the project lacks specific details on how the self-heating effect is quantified and managed beyond the use of a buffer amplifier, and there is no explicit mention of the maximum current through the NTC. Additionally, the report does not mention any optional filtering stage, which, while not essential, could be relevant for signal integrity.

Given these considerations, the project meets most of the essential requirements but lacks explicit detail on the self-heating effect management, which is a critical aspect of the design.
