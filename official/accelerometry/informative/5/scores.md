Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and feedback capacitance (C_f) are provided as 620 kΩ and 1 nF, respectively. The product of R_f and C_f is R_f * C_f = 620e3 * 1e-9 = 0.62 s. The target value is 2/π = 0.637. The calculated R_f * C_f is within 10% of 2/π, so this requirement is met.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (A_v) is given as 1 MV/C, which is equivalent to 1e6 V/C. Using the formula G x 1.61p / C_f, we get (1e6 V/C * 1.61e-12 C/p) / 1e-9 F = 1.61 V/p. This value is not within 10% of the target value of 1, so this requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is assumed to be 1000 pC for a 1 V peak-to-peak output. This is not within 10% of the required 161 pC, so this requirement is not met.

4. The bias current is not explicitly mentioned in the summary, so this requirement is not met.

5. The relationship 0.01 / R_f = bias current is not provided or calculated, so this requirement is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is mentioned, so this requirement is met.

7. The project is optimised for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, and the feedback resistor was selected to achieve a bandwidth from 0.25 Hz to 2 Hz, as calculated using the formula f_L = 1 / (2 * π * R_f * C_f). This implies that calculations for optimization at 2 Hz are included, so this requirement is met.

8. The output voltage is given as 1 V peak-to-peak, which meets the requirement, so this requirement is met.

9. The offset voltage is not mentioned, and there is no information on measures taken to ensure it is below 10 mV, so this requirement is not met.
