Both sensors have d.c. output, so no demodulation should be used. (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n2. Both sensors must be amplified (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n3. The pressure sensor must be inserted in a wheatstone bridge and amplified by a instrumentation amplifier\n4. An ADC should be used (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n5. Infrared radiation sensors are being linearized either digitally in the computer or by using diode networks or log amplifiers. (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n6. The solution mentions the sampling order strategy, if it'll be sequential, simultaneously, etc\n7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is not less than 800 Hz (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency\n9. The low pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency.\n10. There are low-pass filters (or anti-aliasing filters) to reduce aliasing, which are positioned before the multiplexer(s)\n11. The project uses multiplexer(s) to choose channels (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n12. The multiplexer(s) are solid state\n\nYou will categorize the summary into 1 of 5 categories:\n\"optimal\" - use this if the all requirements were reached\n\"acceptable\" - use this category if the project can be implemented and doesn't have any fatal issues, but the score isn't perfect.\n\"generic\" - use this category if the project is theoretically correct and can be implemented, but too generic to have real value.\n\"unfeasible\" - use this if the project is theoretically correct, but contains elements that makes it impossible to implement\n\"incorrect\" - the information provided is conceptually wrong\n\nRequirements marked as essential must be fulfilled in order for a good verdict.\nYou must think as a project designer if the solution is applicable and well thought out.\n\nYou will provide explanations regarding your verdict, the explanations must explicitly indicate which requirements were not reached.\nYou always follow the exact following template in markdown blocks, where all caps words are placeholders for you to fill in.\nInside the verdict placeholder, you will provide only the chosen category.\n\n\n```explanations\nEXPLANATIONS HERE\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nVERDICT_CATEGORY\n```\n\n"

    "response": "```explanations\nThe provided summary meets several key requirements but lacks specific information on a few critical aspects. \n\n1. It is implied that the sensors have a DC output since no mention of demodulation is made.\n2. Amplification of both sensors is planned with specified gains.\n3. The pressure sensor is intended to be used with an instrumentation amplifier, but there is no explicit mention of it being part of a Wheatstone bridge configuration.\n4. An ADC is mentioned, with a recommendation for at least 10-bit resolution.\n5. Linearization of the temperature sensors is planned to be handled digitally, which is acceptable.\n6. The sampling strategy is not explicitly mentioned (sequential, simultaneous, etc.).\n7. The sampling frequency is not explicitly stated, only that the multiplexer supports a sampling rate of \"at least 1 kSps per channel,\" which could imply that the requirement is met if the overall sampling frequency remains above 800 Hz after considering the number of channels.\n8. The anti-aliasing filter is suggested to have a cutoff frequency at or slightly below 400 Hz, but there is no information regarding the attenuation at half the sampling frequency.\n9. The cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter is at the lower bound of the acceptable range (400 Hz) but lacks details on whether it is less than half the total sampling frequency.\n10. Low-pass filters are planned, but their positioning before the multiplexer is not confirmed.\n11. An 8:1 multiplexer is included in the design, satisfying this requirement.\n12. The multiplexer (ADG1608) is a solid-state device.\n\nWhile the design outline is generally in line with the requirements, the lack of explicit confirmation on the Wheatstone bridge configuration for the pressure sensor, the sampling strategy, the exact sampling frequency, the anti-aliasing filter's attenuation at half the sampling frequency, and the positioning of the low-pass filters before the multiplexer prevents the project from being categorized as \"optimal.\" The project can be considered \"acceptable\" if it is assumed that the missing details are addressed in the final implementation.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
