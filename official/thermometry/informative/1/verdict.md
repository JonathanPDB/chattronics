Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project presents a comprehensive analog temperature measurement system employing an NTC thermistor with an architecture that includes a linearization stage, amplification, filtering, and measurement. The utilization of an NTC thermistor (Vishay NTCLE100E3) fulfills the requirement of using an NTC sensor. The choice of a parallel resistor for linearization is appropriate to fulfill the linearization requirement, although the exact value of the resistor should be validated experimentally or through a more detailed calculation to ensure the linearization is effective at the specified midpoint of 50 ÂºC.

The design includes a buffer amplifier to prevent loading effects and maintain signal integrity, which is a good practice. The gain stage is considered with a high-level approach, suggesting a gain of 200 to achieve the desired output voltage range of 0 to 20 Volts. However, the gain calculation should be more detailed, accounting for the actual voltage range across the NTC at the temperature extremes. The inclusion of a low-pass filter is a good design choice to reduce noise, although the choice of specific component values should be validated to ensure they meet the needs of the application.

The output stage is well thought out with the inclusion of protection elements and a calibration potentiometer, which can help achieve the required output voltage range and precision. The instructions for setting up and using the system are clear and straightforward.

However, the design does not mention the consideration of the self-heating effect and does not specify the maximum current that passes through the NTC, which is a requirement for the project. This information is critical to ensure the accuracy of the temperature measurements and to prevent the NTC from affecting its own temperature reading.

Overall, the project is well-conceived with a thoughtful approach to each stage of the design, but the omission of the self-heating effect consideration prevents it from being classified as optimal.
