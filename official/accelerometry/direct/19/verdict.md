Verdict: generic

Explanations: 
The project description provides a comprehensive overview of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device using a piezoelectric sensor and charge amplifier, among other components. However, the project brief does not provide specific values or calculations to verify that the requirements have been met. Therefore, the following points are based on the provided information:

1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and capacitance (C_f) are given as 1.5 GÎ© and 0.47 pF, respectively. The product of R_f and C_f is 0.705 sec, which is significantly higher than the required 2/pi (~0.637 sec), even considering a 10% tolerance. This does not meet the requirement.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not explicitly stated, making it impossible to verify if the condition G x 1.61p / C_f is roughly around 1 within a 10% difference.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output of 161 pC is not confirmed with any calculations related to the sensitivity of the accelerometer and the expected vibration levels.

4. While the project mentions the use of a FET input op-amp to ensure low bias current, the specific bias current value is not provided.

5. The relation between 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance and the bias current is not explicitly confirmed.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is in line with the requirements.

7. The project is designed to be optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, but specific calculations to back this up are not provided.

8. The requirement for a 1 V peak-to-peak output voltage is mentioned but not substantiated with calculations.

9. There is mention of calibration routines to compensate for sensor and system offsets, which suggests an intention to keep the offset below 10 mV, but no specific design decisions or calculations confirm this.

Due to the lack of specific values and calculations, it is challenging to accurately assess the project's compliance with the requirements. The project description is theoretically sound and suggests a system that could be implemented, but without the necessary details, it is impossible to categorically state that all requirements have been met.
