Design Summary for Analog Temperature Measurement System Using an NTC Thermistor

Temperature Sensing and Conditioning:
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor, typically 10kΩ at 25°C, beta value of 3977K.
- Linearization: Achieved by a resistor in parallel with the thermistor to linearize response around 50°C midpoint of the desired temperature range (10°C to 90°C). Parallel resistor value should match the thermistor's resistance at 50°C, calculated by the beta formula.
- Buffer Amplifier: Non-inverting unity-gain buffer using an operational amplifier like OPA333 or AD8605 to avoid loading the thermistor network and preserve signal integrity.

Amplification and Filtering:
- Gain Stage: Non-inverting amplifier configuration with an operational amplifier. Gain (Av) calculated based on the desired output range and the output of the buffer stage. Assuming an input of 0-1V from the buffer, a gain of 20 will scale this to 0-20V. Precision metal film resistors (1kΩ for R1 and 19kΩ for R2) to be used for setting gain.
- Low-Pass Filter: Second-order active Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency around 10 Hz. Assuming Op-Amp supply voltage of +/-15V, component values of R1 = R2 = 15.9kΩ and C1 = C2 = 1µF can be used.

Output Stage:
- Operational Amplifier: Rail-to-rail output operational amplifier like the LM324 for general-purpose applications or the OPA4140 for precision measurements.
- Gain Setting Resistors: Gain set based on the maximum signal voltage from previous stages to achieve a full 0-20V output range. Resistor values determined by the target gain.
- Protection Circuitry: Optional diodes for over-voltage or reverse polarity protection, if required.

Additional Considerations:
- Power Supply: Decoupling network with capacitors (0.1µF to 10µF) to provide filtering and stability.
- Environmental Protection: The NTC thermistor should be protected from direct contact with the water, potentially using suitable encapsulation.

Note: This design summary is based on assumptions and typical values due to the lack of specific user-defined parameters. Final component values and configurations should be refined based on detailed system requirements and actual operational conditions.
