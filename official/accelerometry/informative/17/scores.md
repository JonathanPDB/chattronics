Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) is given as 6.8 MΩ, and the feedback capacitance (Cf) is 100 fF. The product Rf × Cf = 6.8 MΩ × 100 fF = 0.68 s. This product is not around the required 2/pi (≈ 0.637), and the discrepancy is greater than the allowed 10% difference.
2. The gain of the charge amplifier (G) is calculated as 10^4 V/C. Using the given formula G × 1.61E-12 / Cf, we get (10^4 V/C × 1.61E-12) / 100 fF = 0.161. This is not roughly around 1, as required, and the discrepancy is greater than the allowed 10% difference.
3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not specified, so we cannot confirm if it is around 161 pC.
4. The bias current is not provided explicitly.
5. The bias current calculation using 0.01 / Rf would be 0.01 / 6.8 MΩ, but since the bias current is not provided, this requirement is not met.
6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is confirmed in the overview.
7. The project is optimized for low-frequency vibration measurement, and the charge amplifier is designed with a low cutoff frequency of 0.25 Hz, which suggests optimization for low frequencies. However, there are no explicit calculations provided for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude.
8. The output voltage of the charge amplifier is designed to be 1 V peak to peak, which is confirmed in the charge amplifier gain calculation.
9. The offset voltage is not mentioned, so we cannot confirm if it's kept below 10 mV.

In summary, the project summary explicitly covers requirements 6 and 8. The other requirements are either not met or not sufficiently detailed to confirm compliance.
