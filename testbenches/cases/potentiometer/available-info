1. The potentiometer is linear
2. The value of the potentiometer is 10 kOhms
3. The input voltage range should be between -10 and 10 Volts
4. The angle range that the potentiometer should be able to measure is from 0 to 180 degrees
5. The structure should be able to measure at least 20 evenly spaced out angles
6. The sampling rate of the DAQ is 1000 samples per second.
7. Frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz should be already damped
8. The maximum absolute accepted voltage of the DAQ is 7 V.
