Score: 7
Explanations: 
The project summary covers the following requirements:

1. The output is being measured by a multimeter - This requirement is explicitly mentioned in the project aim.
2. There should be an amplification stage and the gain must be provided and justified - The gain stage is described with an initial gain of 10 and a potentiometer for adjustment.
3. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is between 0 and 20 Volts - The project aims to output a corresponding voltage in the range of 0-20V.
4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC - The parallel resistor is used to linearize the response of the thermistor around the midpoint temperature of 50°C.
5. The NTC is linearized - This is confirmed with the use of the parallel resistor for linearization.
6. The architecture should consist roughly of the sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering, and measurement - The project describes all these stages.
7. The sensor used is an NTC - The sensor is explicitly mentioned as a Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor.
8. The self-heating effect is taken into account and the maximum current that passes through the NTC is known - This requirement is not explicitly mentioned or addressed in the project summary.

Therefore, out of the 8 requirements, the project summary successfully covers 7 requirements. The only requirement not addressed is the self-heating effect and the maximum current through the NTC.
