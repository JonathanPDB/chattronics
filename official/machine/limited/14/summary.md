Pressure and Temperature Data Acquisition System for Machine Monitoring

PressureSensorArray:
- Eight Honeywell 26PC Series pressure sensors with a range of 0-10 bar and an accuracy of 0.25% Full Scale (FS) or better.
- Sensors output a maximum signal of 1 mV, corresponding to the maximum pressure to be measured.

InstrumentationAmplifiers_pressure:
- Each sensor's signal is amplified using a three-op-amp instrumentation amplifier configuration.
- Gain required to scale 1 mV to the full ADC range (assumed 0-5V): 5000 (calculated as 5V / 1mV).
- Precision resistors (0.1% tolerance) and op-amps (e.g., AD620 or INA118) with low offset voltage (< 1 mV) and low drift (< 10 µV/°C).
- CMRR: > 100 dB, Bandwidth: > 1 kHz, Dual-supply voltage: ±15 V.

TempSensorArray:
- Eight infrared radiation temperature sensors, suggested MLX90614 from Melexis.
- Temperature Range: -70°C to +380°C, Resolution: 0.02°C, Accuracy: ±0.5°C to ±1%.
- Output: Digital (PWM or SMBus), eliminating the need for NonLinearToLinearConversion.

Multiplexer1 (Pressure Sensor Signals):
- 8-channel analog multiplexer, suggested CD4051B CMOS.
- On-Resistance: < 100 ohms, Crosstalk: -80 dB or better, Operating Voltage: 5V.

Multiplexer2 (Temperature Sensor Signals):
- 8-channel analog multiplexer (considered the same specifications as Multiplexer1).
- Each MUX input has a low-pass filter to reduce noise. Assuming a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz and a resistor value of 10 kΩ, capacitor value is selected as 33 nF (calculated using C = 1/(2*pi*R*f_c)).

SampleAndHold:
- Acquisition time: < 2.5 µs.
- Holding Capacitor: 0.1 µF to 1 µF.
- Op-Amp Slew Rate: ≥5 V/µs, Bandwidth: ≥4 MHz.
- FET On-Resistance: ≤100 Ohms.

AntiAliasingFilter:
- Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter with a second-order (two-pole) design.
- Cutoff Frequency: 400 Hz.
- Precision metal film resistors (1% tolerance) and ceramic capacitors (5% tolerance).
- Operational Amplifier: OPA2134 or AD823 with a minimum bandwidth of 1 MHz.

ADC:
- 12-bit SAR ADC with an SPI interface.
- Sampling rate: ≥1 kHz per channel.
- Input Voltage Range: up to 5V.
- A 16:1 analog multiplexer to handle multiple sensor inputs.

DataInterface:
- Data transfer rate: ≥12 kB/s (considering 12-bit resolution at 1 kHz sampling rate per channel).
- Communication Protocol: USB (Universal Serial Bus) 2.0 or Ethernet for network-based monitoring.
- Data format: [Start Byte | Sensor ID | Data (High Byte) | Data (Low Byte) | Checksum].

The design of each block has been based on general best practices and should be further refined based on empirical testing and specific application constraints. Component values and calculations have been provided to ensure compatibility across the different stages of the data acquisition system.
