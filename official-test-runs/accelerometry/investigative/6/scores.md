Score: 2
Explanations: 
The given project summary successfully covers the following requirements:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) must be roughly around 2/pi: Rf = 10 MΩ, Cf = 64 nF, thus Rf * Cf = 640 µs. The target value is 2/pi µs ≈ 0.637 µs. The actual product is 1000 times larger, so this requirement is not met.

2. The charge amplifier gain multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance should be roughly around 1: G = 10^7 V/C, Cf = 64 nF. G x 1.61E-12 / Cf = 10^7 x 1.61E-12 / 64E-9 = 0.2515625, which is not within 10% of 1, so this requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC. The project summary does not provide explicit information to confirm this requirement.

4. The bias current must be provided. The project summary does not mention the bias current explicitly.

5. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current. Since the bias current is not provided, this requirement cannot be evaluated.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor. This requirement is met as the summary specifies the use of a charge amplifier.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude and has calculations to back it up. The summary discusses optimization around 2 Hz but does not mention the 5 cm amplitude or provide explicit calculations, so this requirement is not met.

8. The output voltage is 1 V peak to peak. This requirement is met as the gain calculation is based on a 1 V peak to peak output.

9. The offset should be kept below 10 mV. The project summary does not provide explicit information about the offset voltage, so this requirement cannot be confirmed.

In summary, out of the 9 requirements, only 2 are clearly met (6 and 8), while the others are either not met or not explicitly confirmed by the provided information.
