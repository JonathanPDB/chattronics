Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a comprehensive outline for a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device using a piezoelectric accelerometer and a charge amplifier, among other components. However, to judge the project against the specific requirements given, several key points must be addressed:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and capacitance (Cf) product should be around 2/pi. In this design, Rf = 2.7 MΩ and Cf = 220 pF. The product Rf * Cf = 2.7 MΩ * 220 pF = 594 pF MΩ. The target value is 2/pi = 0.637 MΩ pF, and the design is off by a significant margin, thus not meeting the requirement. 

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (G) must satisfy the equation G * 1.61p / Cf ≈ 1. The gain provided is 2 V/nC = 2e9 V/C. Using Cf = 220 pF, G * 1.61p / Cf = (2e9 * 1.61e-12) / 220e-12 ≈ 14.59, which is significantly higher than the requirement of being around 1 (with up to 10% difference allowed).

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC, which is not explicitly stated in the project summary, so it's unclear if this requirement is met.

4. The bias current must be provided, and 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current. The feedback resistance is given as 2.7 MΩ, so the bias current should be 0.01 / 2.7 MΩ = 3.7 nA. This information is not provided in the summary, so it's unclear if this requirement is met.

5. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is in line with the requirements.

6. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude with calculations to back it up, which is consistent with the sensor's frequency response range and measurement range.

7. The output voltage is 1 V peak to peak, which matches the gain calculation provided in the charge amplifier section.

8. The offset is kept below 10 mV, as indicated by the bias voltage specification of the piezoelectric accelerometer.

Despite the project being theoretically correct and potentially implementable, it does not meet the specific performance requirements given, particularly in terms of the feedback resistance and capacitance product, and the gain equation. Therefore, the project cannot be considered optimal or acceptable.
