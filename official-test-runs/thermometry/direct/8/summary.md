ANALOG WATER TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM DESIGN

The proposed design for an analog water temperature measurement system uses an NTC thermistor to measure the temperature of water and outputs a voltage between 0 and 20 volts, suitable for measurement with a multimeter.

NTC Thermistor:
- Sensor Type: Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor.
- Typical Resistance at 25 degrees Celsius: 10k ohms.
- Estimated Thermistor Resistance at 50 degrees Celsius (midpoint): 4966 ohms, calculated using the Beta formula and assuming a Beta value of 3950K.

Parallel Resistor for Linearization:
- The parallel resistor is chosen to match the thermistor resistance at the midpoint of the desired temperature range (50 degrees Celsius).
- Parallel Resistor Value: 4966 ohms, chosen for improved linearity around the midpoint temperature.

Linearization Circuit:
- Topology: Wheatstone bridge combined with an operational amplifier.
- Resistors in Bridge: All resistors in the bridge, including the thermistor and parallel resistor, are assumed to be 10k ohms for the initial design, with the parallel resistor adjusted to 4966 ohms for linearization at 50 degrees Celsius.
- Op-Amp: A precision op-amp like the AD8628 is used for its low offset voltage.

Gain Stage:
- Topology: Non-inverting operational amplifier configuration.
- Op-Amp: A general-purpose precision op-amp such as the TL071 or the LM358.
- Feedback Resistors: Assuming a 1kΩ input resistor, a 19kΩ feedback resistor to achieve a gain of 20, mapping a 0-1V input to a 0-20V output.

Level Shifter:
- Topology: Op-Amp Adder Circuit using a precision op-amp with rail-to-rail capability.
- Op-Amp: Analog Devices AD8628 or similar.
- Resistors: Precision metal film resistors with 0.1% tolerance and low temperature coefficient.
- Voltage Reference: A stable reference like the LM4040 for creating the DC offset voltage.
- Series Resistor for Voltage Reference: Calculated to achieve the desired DC offset required to shift the Gain Stage output to the 0-20V range.

Buffer Amplifier:
- Topology: Op-Amp based voltage follower (unity gain buffer).
- Op-Amp: TL071 or LM358.
- Bypass Capacitors: 0.1 µF ceramic capacitors placed close to the power supply pins of the op-amp.

Anti-Aliasing Filter:
- Topology: Second-order low-pass Butterworth filter.
- Op-Amp: A low-noise, precision op-amp compatible with the supply voltage.
- Resistors: 10kΩ precision resistors.
- Capacitors: 15.9 µF (rounded to the nearest standard value of 16 µF) capacitors.

Output Buffer:
- Op-Amp: A precision rail-to-rail op-amp, such as the LM324 or OPAx132.
- The output buffer ensures the voltage remains within the 0-20V range, even when connected to the multimeter.

Multimeter:
- A True RMS digital multimeter with high input impedance (typically >10 MΩ) is recommended.
- The multimeter should be capable of measuring up to at least 20V with a resolution of at least 0.1V and an accuracy of at least 0.5%.

Environmental Considerations:
- All components should be selected to operate within the temperature range of 10 to 90 degrees Celsius.
- The circuit should be designed to minimize self-heating of the thermistor below 1%.

Additional Notes:
- Protection mechanisms should be included, such as ESD protection for the output buffer.
- Calibration of the multimeter and the system is recommended before use to ensure accurate temperature readings.
- Stability and noise-reduction techniques should be employed, such as proper grounding and decoupling.
