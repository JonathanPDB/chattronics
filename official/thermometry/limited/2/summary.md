Analog Instrumentation for Water Temperature Measurement

Project architecture encompasses a thermistor-based temperature sensing system that outputs a voltage corresponding to the temperature range of 10 to 90 degrees Celsius. The voltage output is designed to range from 0 to 20 Volts to be compatible with a standard multimeter.

   - Beta value (assumed): 3950K
   - Operating range: 10 to 90°C
   - Accuracy: Target ±1°C
   - Sensitivity: Variable due to NTC nature; linearized at 50°C midpoint

2. **Linearization Resistor (R_lin):** 
   - Value: 3.6kΩ (standard value close to calculated 3.57kΩ for linearity at midpoint)
   - Tolerance: 1% or better
   - Power rating: 1/4 W

3. **Excitation Source (V_exc):** 
   - Options: 
     - Regulated power supply (e.g., LM7805 for 5V output)
     - Precision voltage reference (e.g., REF02 for 5V or AD1582 for 2.5V output)
   - Voltage Level: Between 1V and 5V (selected to minimize self-heating)
   - Filter Capacitor: 10 µF for noise suppression

4. **Buffer Amplifier:**
   - Configuration: Voltage follower (unity gain buffer)
   - Op-Amp Selection: FET-input operational amplifier (Rail-to-rail capability)
   - Gain: 1 (Unity gain)
   - Input Impedance: Very high (in the MΩ range)
   - Output Impedance: Low
   - Bandwidth: A few kHz
   - Power Supply: 24V single supply

5. **Gain Stage:**
   - Configuration: Non-inverting operational amplifier configuration
   - Gain Range: Adjustable between 1 and 20
   - Op-Amp: OPA197 or a similar rail-to-rail precision op-amp
   - Feedback Resistor (R1): 19kΩ
   - Input Resistor (R2): 1kΩ
   - Gain Calculation: Gain = 1 + (R1/R2) ≈ 20
   - Adjustability: 20kΩ potentiometer in lieu of R1 for calibration

6. **Offset Adder:**
   - Configuration: Non-inverting summing amplifier
   - Op-Amp: Low offset voltage, rail-to-rail op-amp (e.g., OPA2330 or AD8605)
   - Feedback Resistors (Rf1, Rf2): 10kΩ each
   - Input Resistor (Rin): 10kΩ
   - Offset Voltage Source (Vos): Precision reference or potentiometer divider
   - Power Supply: ±12V or ±15V with decoupling capacitors

7. **Output Amplifier:**
   - Configuration: Non-inverting amplifier
   - Gain: Set to scale maximum input voltage to 20V output
   - Op-Amp: Rail-to-rail output op-amp supporting single-supply up to 24V
   - Feedback and input resistors to be determined based on Offset Adder output level

8. **Multimeter:**
   - Input Impedance: At least 10 MΩ
   - Voltage Accuracy/Resolution: At least 1 mV resolution, ±(0.5% + 1 digit) accuracy
   - Sampling Rate: Low rate sufficient for steady-state, higher rate for transients if needed
   - Data Logging: If required, select a multimeter with this capability
   - Environmental Protection: Standard indoor laboratory conditions assumed

The approach described above outlines a robust system for measuring the temperature of water within a beaker and translating it into a measurable voltage range suitable for a multimeter without the need for an ADC or digital processing. Component selections and configurations are based on standard design practices and educated assumptions in the absence of specific user requirements.
