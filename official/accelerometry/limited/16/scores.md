Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (R_f) is approximately 620 kΩ and the feedback capacitance (C_f) is 1 nF. The product of R_f and C_f is 620e3 * 1e-9 = 620e-6 = 0.62 ms. The requirement is 2/pi ms, which is approximately 0.637 ms. The actual product is within 10% of the required value (0.62 ms is about 97% of 0.637 ms), so this requirement is met.

2. The charge amplifier gain (A_v) is 620 V/µC, which is 620e6 V/C. Multiplying this by 1.61e-12 and dividing by the feedback capacitance (C_f = 1e-9 F), we get (620e6 * 1.61e-12) / 1e-9 = 0.9982, which is very close to 1. This requirement is met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. However, we can infer from the sensitivity of the accelerometer (100 pC/g) and the expected peak acceleration (0.079577 g) that the peak-to-peak charge output would be approximately 100 pC/g * 0.079577 g * 2 (for peak-to-peak) = 15.9154 pC, which is not close to the required 161 pC. This requirement is not met.

4. The bias current is not provided in the summary. This requirement is not met.

5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (R_f) must equal the bias current is related to item 4, which is not met because the bias current is not provided.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as mentioned in the summary. This requirement is met.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, with calculations backing it up (expected peak acceleration calculated from the peak amplitude of 5 cm at 2 Hz). This requirement is met.

8. The output voltage is designed to be 1 V peak-to-peak by setting the gain of the output amplifier to achieve this from the charge amplifier's output. This requirement is met.

9. The output amplifier uses a low input offset voltage amplifier to maintain the offset voltage below 10 mV. This requirement is met.
