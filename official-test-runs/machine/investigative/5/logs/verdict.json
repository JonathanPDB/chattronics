Both sensors have d.c. output, so no demodulation should be used. (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n2. Both sensors must be amplified (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n3. The pressure sensor must be inserted in a wheatstone bridge and amplified by a instrumentation amplifier\n4. An ADC should be used (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n5. Infrared radiation sensors are being linearized either digitally in the computer or by using diode networks or log amplifiers. (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n6. The solution mentions the sampling order strategy, if it'll be sequential, simultaneously, etc\n7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is not less than 800 Hz (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency\n9. The low pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency.\n10. There are low-pass filters (or anti-aliasing filters) to reduce aliasing, which are positioned before the multiplexer(s)\n11. The project uses multiplexer(s) to choose channels (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n12. The multiplexer(s) are solid state\n\nYou will categorize the summary into 1 of 5 categories:\n\"optimal\" - use this if the all requirements were reached\n\"acceptable\" - use this category if the project can be implemented and doesn't have any fatal issues, but the score isn't perfect.\n\"generic\" - use this category if the project is theoretically correct and can be implemented, but too generic to have real value.\n\"unfeasible\" - use this if the project is theoretically correct, but contains elements that makes it impossible to implement\n\"incorrect\" - the information provided is conceptually wrong\n\nRequirements marked as essential must be fulfilled in order for a good verdict.\nYou must think as a project designer if the solution is applicable and well thought out.\n\nYou will provide explanations regarding your verdict, the explanations must explicitly indicate which requirements were not reached.\nYou always follow the exact following template in markdown blocks, where all caps words are placeholders for you to fill in.\nInside the verdict placeholder, you will provide only the chosen category.\n\n\n```explanations\nEXPLANATIONS HERE\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nVERDICT_CATEGORY\n```\n\n"

        "content": "Design of a Data Acquisition System for Pressure and Temperature Monitoring\n\nSystem Architecture Overview:\nThe data acquisition system is composed of several key blocks: pressure sensors, temperature sensors, instrumentation amplifiers, a multiplexer, a sample and hold circuit, an anti-aliasing filter, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and a microcontroller. Each block is designed to ensure accurate capture of pressure and temperature data at multiple points on a machine.\n\nPressure Sensors:\n- Type: Strain gauge pressure sensors\n- Output: Maximum of 1 mV\n- Suggested Range: 0-10 bar\n- Sensitivity: Assumed 0.1 mV/bar if the maximum pressure is 10 bar\n- Suggested Model: Honeywell Sensing and Productivity Solutions' Model 19C series\n- Accuracy: 1% full-scale\n\nTemperature Sensors:\n- Type: Infrared radiation detectors for non-contact surface temperature measurement\n- Output: Maximum of 100 mV\n- Suggested Model: MLX90614 with a typical temperature measurement range of -70°C to +380°C\n- Sensitivity and Resolution: Factory-calibrated resolution of 0.02°C and an accuracy of ±0.5°C\n\nInstrumentation Amplifiers:\n- Gain (Pressure): 5000 V/V to amplify the 1 mV sensor signal to a standard ADC input range of 5V\n- Gain (Temperature): 50 V/V to amplify the 100 mV sensor signal to the same ADC input range\n- Suggested Op-Amp: Precision type such as AD620 or INA128\n- Other: Use of precision resistors for accurate gain setting\n\nMultiplexer:\n- Type: 16:1 analog CMOS multiplexer\n- Bandwidth: \u003e4 kHz to handle the maximum signal frequency of 400 Hz\n- Suggested Model: ADG1606 from Analog Devices\n- On-Resistance: Less than 100 ohms\n- Crosstalk: -80 dB or better\n- Switching Time: Less than one microsecond\n\nSample \u0026 Hold Circuit:\n- Op-Amp: High-speed precision op-amp, like AD8031 or OPA657\n- Sampling Capacitor: Around 0.1 to 1 μF, polypropylene or Teflon type\n- Buffer: A high-speed buffer to drive the ADC input\n\nAnti-Aliasing Filter:\n- Type: Active Low-Pass\n- Configuration: Sallen-Key\n- Order: 2nd (attenuation rate of -40 dB/decade)\n- Cutoff Frequency: 600 Hz\n- Components: Low-noise op-amp with \u003e2 MHz bandwidth, 1% metal film resistors, low-tolerance capacitors\n\nAnalog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):\n- Type: SAR ADC\n- Resolution: At least 12-bit to achieve the desired 1% accuracy\n- Interface: Assume SPI for high data rates\n- Input Range: Assumes a unipolar range compatible with the amplified sensor outputs\n\nMicrocontroller/Processor:\n- Capabilities: Must handle real-time digital filtering, control the multiplexer, and manage data acquisition\n- Flexible communication interfaces such as USB, SPI, I2C, UART, or Ethernet\n- Adequate memory to buffer data if needed\n\nGeneral Assumptions and Recommendations:\n- The exact specifications of the pressure and temperature ranges, ADC sampling rate, and other numerical values need to be defined based on the system's application.\n- A conservative design approach has been taken, assuming typical industrial conditions and standard component ranges.\n- The system is designed to meet a general accuracy requirement of 1% for both pressure and temperature measurements.\n- All suggested models and types are subject to change based on the final application requirements and component availability."

    "response": "```explanations\nThe project has several commendable aspects that align with the requirements, but there are critical areas where it falls short or lacks specificity.\n\n1. Both sensors have d.c. output, which complies with requirement 1.\n2. The use of instrumentation amplifiers with specified gains for both sensors satisfies requirement 2.\n3. The pressure sensor is mentioned to be used alongside an instrumentation amplifier, but there is no explicit mention of a Wheatstone bridge, which is a fatal flaw in meeting requirement 3.\n4. An ADC is included in the design, fulfilling requirement 4.\n5. Linearization for infrared radiation sensors is not clearly addressed in the design, which is a fatal flaw against requirement 5.\n6. The sampling order strategy is not discussed, leaving requirement 6 unmet.\n7. The ADC sampling rate is not specified, failing to meet requirement 7.\n8. \u0026 9. The anti-aliasing filter design is specified with a cutoff frequency of 600 Hz, which is higher than 400 Hz and less than half the unspecified ADC sampling frequency, but without the sampling frequency, it is not possible to confirm if it satisfies requirements 8 and 9.\n10. The anti-aliasing filter is mentioned, but its position relative to the multiplexer(s) is not specified, which is crucial in meeting requirement 10.\n11. The project uses a multiplexer, which meets requirement 11.\n12. The multiplexer is solid-state, fulfilling requirement 12.\n\nThe project fails to meet several critical requirements and lacks specificity in some areas, rendering the design incomplete and not fully practical in its current form.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nunfeasible\n```",
