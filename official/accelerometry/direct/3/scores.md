Score: 3
Explanations: 
The project summary provides detailed information about the design of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device using a piezoelectric accelerometer and a charge amplifier. Let's evaluate it based on the given requirements:

1. The feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance (Rf x Cf) is not mentioned explicitly, but we are given Cf as 12.8 pF. The resistance is only mentioned in the context of the low-pass filter, which is not necessarily the feedback resistance of the charge amplifier. Thus, we cannot confirm compliance with this requirement.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (G) is given as 78.125 MV/pC, and the feedback capacitance (Cf) is 12.8 pF. The calculation would be G x 1.61E-12 / Cf = (78.125E6 x 1.61E-12) / 12.8E-12 = 9.875, which is not roughly around 1. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

3. The expected peak charge is listed as 6.4 pC, which is not around the required 161 pC. This requirement is not met.

4. The bias current is not provided explicitly in the summary. Hence, we cannot confirm this requirement is met.

5. We cannot evaluate this requirement because the feedback resistance (Rf) is not given, and therefore we cannot calculate the bias current as 0.01 / Rf.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which meets this requirement.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, and calculations are provided to back this up (e.g., peak acceleration and expected peak charge). This requirement is met.

8. The desired peak-to-peak voltage output of the charge amplifier is stated to be 1 V, which meets this requirement.

9. The maximum offset voltage is stated to be below 10 mV, which meets the requirement for the offset to be kept below 10 mV.

Based on these evaluations, the project summary successfully covers 3 out of the 9 requirements.
