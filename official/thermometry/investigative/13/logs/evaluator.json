There is an amplification stage with a gain of 10, which is adjustable using a potentiometer. However, the justification for the specific gain value is not provided.\n3. The output voltage range is not explicitly mentioned to be between 0 and 20 Volts.\n4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50°C, as mentioned in the Thermistor Sensor Block and Signal Conditioning Block.\n5. Linearization of the NTC is stated, which is necessary for the project.\n6. The architecture consists of a sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, and optional filtering, fitting the required structure.\n7. The sensor used is an NTC (Vishay NTCLE100E3), which is necessary for the project.\n8. The self-heating effect is taken into account by using a high-value fixed resistor to limit the current through the NTC, as mentioned in the Thermistor Sensor Block.\n\nRequirements not explicitly covered:\n3.
