You will be presented with a project idea and you will propose a high level architecture of the project.
All conditioning is done in the analog domain.
The diagram must be of the effective signal path, therefore, do not include block such as "power supply", "biasing" or any other blocks that dont describe the signal path, unless they have some sort of important detail.
