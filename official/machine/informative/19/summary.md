Analog Instrumentation System for Machine Pressure and Temperature Monitoring

Pressure Sensors:
- Sensor Type: Strain-gauge pressure sensor
- Model: Honeywell Sensotec Series (specific model selected based on pressure range)
- Pressure Range: 0-100 PSI (typical range for industrial applications)
- Accuracy: 1%
- Output: Maximum 1 mV (strain-gauge output)
- Sensitivity: Assuming 0.01 mV/PSI for the initial design, the exact value to be obtained from the sensor datasheet

Instrumentation Amplifiers (1-8 for Pressure Sensors):
- Gain: Approximately 4000 (to output a voltage range of 0.5V to 4.5V given a maximum input of 1mV)
- Power Supply: ±15V (typical for industrial applications)
- CMRR: >100 dB
- Bandwidth: Wider than the signal frequency of interest (2 kHz minimum recommended)

Temperature Sensors:
- Sensor Type: Infrared radiation detector
- Model: Melexis MLX90614 (for its ease of use and digital output capabilities)
- Temperature Range: -70°C to +380°C
- Accuracy: ±0.5°C
- Resolution: 0.02°C
- Power Supply: 3.3V to 5V
- Environmental Conditions: Standard industrial, with potential enhancement for harsh conditions

Transimpedance Amplifiers (1-8 for Temperature Sensors):
- Feedback Resistor (Rf): 100 kΩ (assuming maximum input current of 1 µA to achieve 100 mV output)
- Feedback Capacitor (Cf): 1 pF (for bandwidth of at least 2 kHz)
- Op-amp: Low input bias current, low noise (e.g., AD8221 or OPA657)

Multiplexers (1 for Pressure, 2 for Temperature):
- Type: 8-channel analog multiplexer (e.g., CD4051B CMOS or ADG704)
- Bandwidth: Exceeding the maximum signal frequency of interest (at least 2 kHz)
- Supply Voltage: Compatible with ±5V to ±15V supplies

Low Pass Filters (1 for Pressure, 2 for Temperature):
- Type: 4th-order Butterworth for maximal flatness in passband (or Bessel for improved phase linearity, if necessary)
- Cutoff Frequency: 500 Hz (to include signal frequencies up to 400 Hz)
- Component Values (for 4th-order): Two stages with resistors R1, R2 = 3.18 kΩ, capacitors C1, C2 = 100 nF, using standard operational amplifiers

ADCs (1 for Pressure, 2 for Temperature):
- Resolution: At least 12-bit for both pressure and temperature to maintain accuracy
- Sampling Rate: ≥ 2 kHz for pressure to capture up to 400 Hz signals, adjustable rate for temperature depending on the signal frequency content
- Type: SAR ADC recommended for moderate sampling rates (e.g., for pressure), interface type to be determined based on data processing unit and system requirements

Data Processing Unit:
- Processor: ARM Cortex series or a Texas Instruments DSP
- Memory: RAM and possibly external memory for data buffering
- Interfaces: USB, UART, SPI, I2C, Ethernet (as per system requirement)
- Software: Use of modular software libraries and RTOS for flexibility
- Environment: Designed according to standard industrial specifications

This solution provides a high-level architecture for the analog instrumentation system. It includes potential component selections and design considerations that can be further refined as the project's detailed requirements are made clear. The system is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for adjustments and fine-tuning as more information becomes available.
