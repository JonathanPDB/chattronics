Analog Water Temperature Measurement System

The project entails developing an analog system that measures the temperature of water using a thermistor and outputs a voltage range of 0-20V to be measured by a multimeter.

NTC Thermistor:
- Type: Vishay NTCLE100E3 series, assumed to have a 10k ohm resistance at 25 degrees Celsius and a beta value of approximately 3950K for calculations.
- Waterproofing and environmental protection considerations should be observed based on application needs.

Linearization Resistor:
- To linearize the thermistor response at 50 degrees Celsius (assumed midpoint temperature), calculate the resistance at 50 degrees Celsius (R_50) using the beta value and then determine the parallel resistor (R_p) value.
- Example calculation for R_50 and R_p is omitted as it requires the precise beta value and resistance at the desired temperature.

Wheatstone Bridge:
- Bridge Configuration: Ratiometric with an assumption of 5V excitation voltage.
- Output Voltage Range: Design for 0-100 mV differential voltage output from the bridge.
- Resistors: Use precision resistors of equal value, assumed to be 3.3k ohms each based on the midpoint resistance approximation of the thermistor.

Instrumentation Amplifier:
- Gain Calculation (assuming bridge output of 0-100mV for full temperature range): Aim for a gain of 200 to scale the maximum expected input voltage to 20V output.
- Example Gain Calculation: 
    G = Vout_max / Vin_max
    G = 20V / 0.1V
    G = 200
- Gain-setting Resistor (Rg):
    Rg = 50kΩ / (G - 1)
    Rg ≈ 252.5Ω (use closest standard value, e.g., 255Ω)

Low-Pass Filter:
- Topology: Second-order active Butterworth filter for a flat passband.
- Roll-off Rate: 12 dB/octave (40 dB/decade).
- Cutoff Frequency: 1 Hz.
- Q Factor: 0.707 for critical damping.
- Components and values should be calculated based on op-amp characteristics and desired cutoff frequency.

Output Stage:
- Topology: Op-amp based voltage follower (buffer) with scaling gain to achieve a 0 to 20V output range.
- Gain-setting Resistors (R1 and R2):
    R1 = R2 * (G - 1)
    R1 = 1 kΩ * (200 - 1) = 199 kΩ (use closest standard value, e.g., 200 kΩ)
    R2 = 1 kΩ

Multimeter:
- Features: Digital multimeter with auto-ranging capability, high input impedance (1MΩ or greater), capable of measuring up to 20V.
- Resolution: Typically 1 mV or better for temperature measurement applications.
- Usage: Ensure proper connection of probes observing the polarity of the DC voltage output.

The above solution provides a high-level design approach to the analog temperature measurement system. However, all calculations are based on assumptions and typical values. For a precise design, specific thermistor characteristics, including resistance-temperature relationship, beta value, and exact application requirements, need to be known. Also, the exact power supply voltages available for the system were not specified, and these would have an impact on the design and selection of components, particularly for the instrumentation amplifier and the low-pass filter.
