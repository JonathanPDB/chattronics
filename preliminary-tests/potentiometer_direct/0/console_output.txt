Potentiometer: This is the primary sensor for the project. It converts the angular position of the pendulum to a corresponding resistance value. Since the potentiometer is linear and has a total resistance of 10 kOhms, it will provide a voltage output proportional to the angle of rotation, from 0 to 180 degrees, assuming the entire resistance range corresponds to this angle range. The potentiometer is powered by a -10V to 10V power source.

Buffer: The buffer amplifier is a voltage follower which provides high input impedance to avoid loading the potentiometer and low output impedance to drive the subsequent stages. Its main objective is to ensure the integrity of the signal from the potentiometer without alteration.

Filter: This block represents a band-stop (notch) filter specifically designed to attenuate 50 and 60 Hz frequencies, which are common power line interference frequencies. Given that the DAQ is sampling at 1000 samples per second, which corresponds to a Nyquist frequency of 500 Hz, this filter also serves as an anti-aliasing filter by limiting the bandwidth of the signal to less than half the sampling rate.

Amplifier: The purpose of the amplifier stage is to scale the potentiometer's voltage range to match the DAQ's maximum input voltage range of +/- 7 V. The amplifier provides the necessary gain to ensure the entire angular range results in an output voltage within the acceptable limits of the DAQ.

ProtectionCircuit: This stage is to protect the DAQ from potential overvoltage conditions. It limits the voltage to the DAQ's maximum acceptable range of +/- 7 V. This could be implemented using Zener diodes, voltage clamps, or other protection methods to prevent damage to the DAQ.

DAQ: The Data Acquisition System (DAQ) is the final stage where the conditioned analog signal is sampled at a rate of 1000 samples per second and converted into digital data for further processing and visualization in LabVIEW.

POTENTIOMETER SELECTION FOR PENDULUM ANGLE MEASUREMENT

Based on the project requirements and the absence of specific constraints, I suggest the following specifications for the potentiometer:

Type and Model Suggestion:
- A rotary potentiometer should be used for its ease of attachment to the pendulum and straightforward angular measurement. A good model to consider would be the Bourns 3540S precision potentiometer, which offers high reliability and a good compromise between performance and cost.

Electrical Characteristics:
- Total resistance: 10 kOhms
- Linear taper to ensure a proportional relationship between angle and resistance
- Rated voltage: Potentiometer should be rated for at least the power source voltage of 20 V (from -10 V to +10 V) for safe operation

Mechanical Characteristics:
- Rotational life: Greater than 1 million cycles to ensure longevity, given the repetitive motion of a pendulum
- Shaft material: Metal for durability
- Shaft style: Knurled or slotted for easy attachment of the pendulum arm
- Mounting: Servo mount style might be beneficial for easy integration with the wooden structure

Resolution and Sensitivity:
- With at least 20 evenly spaced angles over a 180-degree range, the resolution should be better than 9 degrees per step. A high-resolution potentiometer is recommended, potentially with a resolution higher than the minimum requirement, to provide more detailed angle information.
- Sensitivity: The change in resistance per degree of rotation should be uniform across the span. Given a 10 kOhm potentiometer over 180 degrees, the sensitivity should be approximately 55.6 Ohms/degree.

Environmental and Operational Limits:
- Operating temperature range: -40°C to +125°C, covering most ambient conditions
- Sealing: If environmental exposure is a concern, an IP-rated (Ingress Protection) potentiometer would be appropriate. However, if the environment is controlled, a standard potentiometer without special sealing might suffice.

Implementation Notes:
- The user should ensure that the potentiometer is mounted securely to prevent any mechanical play, which could affect measurement accuracy.
- Periodic calibration may be required to account for any mechanical wear and to maintain measurement accuracy over time.
- The potentiometer should be protected from any potential over-current conditions which might arise in the event of a fault within the electric circuitry.

Overall, the selected potentiometer should meet the mechanical robustness and electrical precision required for the pendulum angle measurement task, with considerations for environmental exposure and mechanical integration.

BUFFER STAGE

Given the lack of specific information, I will proceed with reasonable assumptions for the buffer stage.

Topology:
- A non-inverting buffer using an operational amplifier (op-amp) is suggested. This topology is also known as a voltage follower. It provides unity gain and high input impedance, which avoids loading the potentiometer.

Op-amp Selection:
- A general-purpose precision op-amp is recommended for this application due to its good trade-off between cost, low noise, and precision. The TL071, which has low noise and high input impedance, is a suitable choice.

Parameters:
- Input Impedance: The input impedance of the op-amp should be very high, ideally greater than 1 MΩ, so as not to load the potentiometer. The TL071 has an input impedance in the range of tera-ohms, which is more than adequate.
- Output Impedance: The buffer's output impedance should be low, typically less than 100 Ω, to drive the subsequent filter stage without significant signal loss. The TL071 inherently has a low output impedance.
- Bandwidth: The op-amp should have a bandwidth sufficient to pass the maximum frequency content of the signal without distortion. The TL071 has a bandwidth of 3 MHz, which will easily accommodate the signal from the potentiometer.
- Slew Rate: The op-amp's slew rate should be high enough to ensure that there is no distortion in the output signal. The TL071 has a slew rate of 13 V/µs, which is more than adequate for this application.
- Power Supply: The op-amp should be powered with a dual supply voltage that matches the potentiometer's power source range, i.e., +/- 10 V.

Implementation Notes:
- The buffer circuit will require bypass capacitors close to the op-amp's power supply pins to filter out any supply noise. A combination of 0.1 µF and 10 µF capacitors (ceramic and electrolytic, respectively) across each supply rail to ground is commonly used.
- The op-amp should be mounted on a socket or directly soldered to a printed circuit board with proper grounding to avoid noise pickup.
- Proper layout and grounding practices should be followed to minimize noise and ensure signal integrity.

The buffer stage is crucial to maintain the signal quality from the sensor (potentiometer) before it is further processed by filtering, amplification, and protection stages.

FILTERING_BLOCK

Topology: Active Twin-T Notch Filter

Given the requirements and the lack of additional information, an active Twin-T notch filter is proposed. This topology is effective in attenuating specific frequencies and can be powered from the same -10V to 10V supply that powers the potentiometer. The active component will provide the necessary gain and quality factor control to fine-tune the attenuation at 50 Hz and 60 Hz.

Design Specifications:
- Stop-band attenuation: Minimum 40 dB at 50 Hz and 60 Hz to adequately suppress power line interference.
- Passband ripple: Less than 0.5 dB to ensure minimal distortion of the signal within the range of interest.
- Phase shift: Minimal phase shift in the passband to preserve the integrity of the signal for accurate angle measurement.
- Group delay variation: To be minimized across the passband to maintain real-time tracking capabilities.

Filter Parameters:
- Type: Notch (Band-stop)
- Order: Second-order (each notch)
- Notch frequencies: 50 Hz and 60 Hz
- Quality factor (Q): 10 (high Q for sharp notches)
- Attenuation depth: Adjustable, set for at least 40 dB

Component Values (Approximate):
- Resistors: Determined based on the desired Q factor and notch depth. For example, four equal resistors (R1 = R2 = R3 = R4) in the Twin-T network, with a value that sets the notch frequency alongside the chosen capacitors.
- Capacitors: Calculated to create the 50 Hz and 60 Hz notch frequencies in conjunction with the resistors. Two capacitors can be of equal value (C1 = C2) and the third (C3) adjusted to set the notch frequency.
- Operational Amplifier: A low-noise op-amp with sufficient bandwidth to operate comfortably at frequencies above the notch frequencies, such as the TL071, should be utilized.

Adjustments:
- Fine-tuning of the resistor and capacitor values may be necessary during the prototype phase to achieve the desired notch depth and bandwidth based on the actual op-amp performance and component tolerances.

Ranges to be filtered out:
- Frequencies around 50 Hz and 60 Hz should be significantly attenuated, with a sharp roll-off to minimize the impact on adjacent frequencies.

Ranges to be kept in:
- Frequencies below 40 Hz and above 70 Hz should pass with minimal attenuation to ensure the full representation of the pendulum motion is captured and can be accurately measured.

With these design parameters, the filter will efficiently attenuate the unwanted power line noise while preserving the integrity of the pendulum's signal for accurate analysis in LabVIEW.

AMPLIFIER_BLOCK

Given the lack of specific details, I will make reasonable assumptions to design the Amplifier block based on standard practices and the information provided.

- The potentiometer range is from -10V to 10V, but since it is being used for an angular measurement from 0 to 180 degrees, the actual output voltage range will be from 0V to 10V (assuming the wiper starts from the ground potential and increases to the maximum as the angle increases).

- The DAQ can accept a maximum voltage of +/-7 V.

Assumptions for Amplifier Design:
- The potentiometer voltage output directly corresponds to the angle, so 0 degrees is 0V, and 180 degrees is 10V.
- The full range of the angular measurement (0 to 180 degrees) should be within the input range of the DAQ.
- To ensure a good resolution, the output voltage range should use as much of the DAQ input range as possible without exceeding it.
- A simple, single-supply operational amplifier (op-amp) configuration can be used for the gain stage.

Given these assumptions, here is the suggested amplifier configuration:

- Non-inverting amplifier topology for positive gain.
- Using a single 15V power supply for the op-amp, which is a common value and can provide positive output voltages within the DAQ range.
- Setting the gain to map 10V (potentiometer maximum) to 7V (DAQ maximum), which is a gain of 0.7.

The gain (G) of a non-inverting amplifier is given by:
G = 1 + (Rf/Rg)

Where Rf is the feedback resistor and Rg is the ground resistor. To achieve a gain of 0.7, we can set Rf/Rg to be -0.3 (since 1 - 0.3 = 0.7). This can be achieved with the following resistor values:
Rf = 3k Ohms
Rg = 10k Ohms

- A precision op-amp should be used to ensure low offset voltage and drift, such as the OPA227 or the AD precision series.

Filtering:
- The amplifier should include a notch filter or a band-reject filter in its feedback loop to dampen the 50 and 60 Hz frequencies. This could be implemented using a twin-T notch filter configuration with properly calculated resistor and capacitor values to target the specific frequencies.

Protection Circuit:
- As an added measure, a protection circuit with clamping diodes can be integrated at the output to prevent the voltage from exceeding +/-7V even under fault conditions.

These suggestions offer a simple and effective amplifier design suitable for the project's requirements. The component values and op-amp selection can be adjusted as per the actual conditions and availability.

ProtectionCircuit

The ProtectionCircuit is an essential part of the signal conditioning block designed to prevent the DAQ from experiencing damaging voltage levels that exceed its maximum input voltage of +/- 7 V. Based on the lack of specific user-supplied information, I will use general good engineering practices to define the protection circuit requirements:

1. Transient Voltage Suppression: The circuit should be able to suppress transients that exceed the DAQ's maximum voltage rating. A common practice is to select components that can handle at least 1.5 times the maximum expected voltage. Therefore, protection components should handle at least +/- 10.5 V.

2. Response Time: Given the DAQ's sampling rate of 1000 samples per second, the protection circuit should react quickly to prevent aliasing of high-frequency transients into the sampled data. Components with a response time in the order of microseconds would be appropriate.

3. Component Types: Solid-state components such as TVS (Transient Voltage Suppression) diodes are commonly used for their fast response times and reliability. Surface mount technology (SMT) components are generally preferred for their compact size and compatibility with modern PCB manufacturing processes.

4. Bidirectional Protection: Since the input voltage to the DAQ can be both positive and negative, bidirectional protection would be necessary. Bidirectional TVS diodes or a combination of unidirectional diodes can be used to achieve this.

5. Standards Compliance: Without specific user requirements, general electronics safety and performance standards such as IEC or UL would be a good baseline. However, for this response, we will not specify components based on certifications but rather on their electrical characteristics.

Considering these requirements, a suitable protection circuit can be designed using bidirectional TVS diodes. The circuit topology suggestion is as follows:

- Place a bidirectional TVS diode with a working voltage slightly above 7 V (e.g., 7.5 V) across the signal line and ground. This ensures that the diode will clamp any voltage that exceeds this threshold, protecting the DAQ from overvoltage conditions.
- Additionally, a series resistor can be added to limit the current into the TVS diode and also into the DAQ during overvoltage conditions. A value of 100 ohms to 1 kOhm can be considered, depending on the desired level of current limiting.

Suggested TVS Diode: SMBJ7.5CA (bidirectional, surface mount, with a standoff voltage of 7.5 V).

Suggested Series Resistor: 100 Ohms, 1/2 Watt (to limit the current to 70 mA at 7 V).

The specific values for the components can be fine-tuned based on further details of the DAQ's input protection requirements, but the provided values offer a general-purpose solution that will protect the DAQ from common overvoltage scenarios.

ANGLE_MEASUREMENT_ADC

Given the requirements of the project and the absence of specific details about the DAQ's ADC, I would recommend the following specifications for the ADC block:

1. Type of ADC: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC.
   - Justification: SAR ADCs provide a good balance between resolution, conversion speed, and cost. They are suitable for medium to high-resolution applications with moderate sampling rates, making them ideal for this project.

2. Resolution: 12 bits or higher.
   - Justification: With a requirement to measure at least 20 evenly spaced angles over a 180-degree range, a 12-bit ADC provides 4096 distinct levels. This allows for a resolution of approximately 0.044 degrees (180/4096), which is sufficient to differentiate between the 20 angles. Higher resolution can be chosen if finer detail is needed.

3. Sampling Rate: At least 1000 samples per second.
   - Justification: The sampling rate matches the DAQ's stated rate and is more than adequate for capturing the dynamics of a swinging pendulum, which is a relatively slow-moving object. This helps in avoiding aliasing and provides a smooth data stream for processing in LabVIEW.

4. Input Voltage Range: Configurable to accept +/- 7V.
   - Justification: To match the DAQ's maximum accepted input voltage and to fully utilize the ADC's dynamic range without the risk of overvoltage damage.

5. Anti-Aliasing Filter: Integrated or external low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency slightly below 500 Hz.
   - Justification: To satisfy the Nyquist criterion and remove unwanted high-frequency noise, including the specific requirement to dampen 50 and 60 Hz signals, ensuring a clean signal for digitization.

6. Interface: Compatibility with standard DAQ communication protocols.
   - Justification: To ensure seamless integration and data transfer to the computer running LabVIEW without the need for custom interface solutions.

7. Accuracy: Ensure that the ADC's inherent accuracy and linearity meet or exceed the resolution. Typically, the accuracy should be within ±1 least significant bit (LSB).
   - Justification: To maintain the integrity of angle measurements without significant quantization errors, ensuring reliable and consistent data acquisition for analysis.

Implementing the ADC within these guidelines should provide robust and precise angle measurements for the pendulum monitoring system using LabVIEW. However, if the specific DAQ model was known, further optimizations could be made to match its exact capabilities and limitations.
