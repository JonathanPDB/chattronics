Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project design for a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device has several good features, but there are discrepancies between the design parameters and the project requirements:

1. The feedback resistor (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) do not meet the requirement of Rf * Cf being roughly around 2/pi (allowing up to 10% difference). Given Rf = 68 MÎ© and Cf = 10 pF, Rf * Cf = 680 ns, which is significantly higher than the target value of approximately 0.637 ns (2/pi = ~0.637, allowing for 10% difference).

2. The gain calculation (G) multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (G x 1.61p / Cf) should be roughly around 1, allowing up to 10% difference. With G = 6.16 * 10^6 V/C and Cf = 10 pF, the value G x 1.61E-12 / Cf = 0.984, which is within the acceptable range.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 162.28 pC, which is close to the required 161 pC.

4. Bias current is mentioned, but the specific value of the bias current is not provided. The requirement for the bias current to be provided and for 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance to equal the bias current is not explicitly met in the provided information.

5. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which aligns with the requirements.

6. The design is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, which is in line with the requirement. However, there is no mention of calculations backing up the optimization for a 5 cm amplitude.

7. The output voltage is specified to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets the requirement.

8. The use of an ultra-low bias current op-amp is mentioned to minimize offset voltage, but there is no explicit confirmation that the offset is kept below 10 mV.

In conclusion, the design does not fully comply with the essential requirements, specifically in the feedback network (Rf * Cf value) and the provision of bias current details. Additionally, there are missing calculations for the optimization of the input oscillation amplitude and no explicit confirmation of the offset voltage.
