Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The provided information on the Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device Design mostly aligns with the requirements; however, there are some discrepancies that need to be addressed:

1. The feedback resistor (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) product is 27 MΩ * 22 pF = 594 pFΩ. The target value to meet the requirement is roughly 2/pi or approximately 0.637 pFΩ. The product provided is significantly higher than the target, which is not within the allowed 10% difference.

2. The gain (G) multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (G x 1.61p / Cf) should be roughly around 1. With the provided values, (510,000 V/C * 1.61E-12) / 22E-12 F ≈ 37.23. This is not close to 1 and is outside the 10% tolerance.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output calculated to be around 161 pC does not match the provided peak charge (Qp) of 1.96 pC. This is a significant deviation from the requirement.

4. The bias current is not explicitly provided. However, it can be calculated as 0.01 / Rf. With Rf = 27 MΩ, the bias current would be approximately 0.37 nA, which must be verified against the actual operational amplifier's bias current specification.

5. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as required.

6. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude and has calculations to back it up.

7. The output voltage is specified as 1 V peak to peak, which aligns with the requirement.

8. The offset voltage specification is below 10 mV, which is acceptable.

Considering these points, the design does not fully meet the essential requirements, particularly with respect to the feedback components' values and the resulting charge amplifier characteristics. Therefore, the project cannot be categorized as 'optimal' or 'acceptable'. Since the design is theoretically correct but contains elements that make it impossible to implement as described, it falls into the 'unfeasible' category.
