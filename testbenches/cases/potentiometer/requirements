1. There is a safety net that stops the output voltage from surpassing the maximum absolute value of 7V.
2. The is an anti-aliasing filter
3. The cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter is specified to be around 10 and 30 Hz.
4. The order of the anti-aliasing filter is specified to be 3 or 4.
5. The architecture is simple: there is a voltage divider, an anti-aliasing filter and then the DAQ measures the voltage.
