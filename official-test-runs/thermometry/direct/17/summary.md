Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water Temperature Monitoring

Overview:
This system is designed to measure the temperature of water in a beaker using an NTC thermistor (Vishay NTCLE100E3) and output a voltage between 0 and 20 volts. The solution includes a linearization network, buffer stage, gain stage, level shifting, low-pass filtering, and an output stage to interface with a multimeter.

Thermistor Sensor:
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor
- Temperature Range: 10 to 90 degrees Celsius
- Self-Heating: Controlled by using a low excitation current to keep the self-heating effect below 1%

Linearization Resistor:
- To linearize the response at the midpoint (50°C), a parallel resistor is used with an approximate value of 3.3 kΩ, calculated from the NTCLE100E3 characteristics.

Buffer Stage:
- Configuration: Voltage follower using a precision op-amp such as OPAx340 series or Analog Devices AD8605.
- Supply Voltage: A single 5V or dual ±15V, depending on the system's availability.
- Characteristics: Low input bias current (< 1 nA), low input offset voltage (< 1 mV), and low noise.

Gain Stage:
- Configuration: Non-inverting amplifier using an op-amp like Texas Instruments OPA2277.
- Required Gain (Assumed): Approximately 10 to map a 0.5V to 2.5V input to a 0-20V output.
- Resistors: R1 = 90kΩ, R2 = 10kΩ, Rtrim (trim pot) = 1kΩ for gain adjustment.
- Power Supply: ±15V is assumed for op-amp power supply.

Level Shifter:
- Assumes a need to adjust the DC level of the signal from the Gain Stage to ensure the output starts at 0V for the lowest temperature.
- Components: Operational amplifier, resistors for setting level shift.
- Specific component values will depend on the actual output range from the Gain Stage.

Low Pass Filter:
- Type: Second-order (two-pole) Butterworth filter for minimal passband ripple.
- Cutoff Frequency: 5 Hz to remove high-frequency noise and provide a clean output signal.
- Op-Amp: Low-noise, precision type like OPA2188, powered within its specified supply voltage range.
- Resistors and Capacitors: Assuming a cutoff of 5 Hz, R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ, C1 = C2 = 0.33 μF.

Output Stage:
- Configuration: Operational amplifier stage to scale the signal to the desired 0-20V output range.
- Op-Amp Recommendation: Same as for the Gain Stage and Low Pass Filter, such as OPA2277 or OPA2188.
- Supply Voltage: At least 24V to ensure the op-amp can output close to 20V.
- Calibration: Trimming potentiometers included for fine-tuning gain and offset.

Multimeter Measurement:
- Multimeter: High input impedance (>1MΩ), with a resolution of at least 1 mV in the 0-20V range.
- Measurement Approach: Direct connection to the output stage with careful calibration at known temperature points.

Environmental Considerations:
- All electronic components should be insulated and protected against moisture or any corrosive atmosphere if present around the measurement setup.
- The NTC thermistor should be waterproofed for immersion in the water beaker.

Calibration and Adjustments:
- The system should be calibrated using known temperature points to ensure accuracy.
- Trimmable components in the gain and output stages allow fine adjustments to match the specific thermistor characteristics and desired voltage output ranges.
