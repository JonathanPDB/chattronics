Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The design for the Analog Water Temperature Measurement System generally meets many of the specified requirements, but there are some concerns and ambiguities that need to be addressed:

1. Amplification Stage: The project specifies multiple amplification stages with defined gains, operational amplifier choices, and configurations. This satisfies the requirement for having an amplification stage and providing the gain.

2. Output Voltage Range: The design aims for a 0 to 20 Volts output range, which is within the specified requirement for the multimeter measurement.

3. Linearization: The proposal mentions a resistive bridge or op-amp-based linearization circuit, which indicates an attempt to linearize the NTC thermistor. However, the project does not provide specific details on how the linearization is optimized for the midrange 50 ºC, which is a critical requirement.

4. Sensor: An NTC thermistor is indeed specified as the sensor, which is a mandatory element of the project.

5. Self-heating Effect: The design takes into account the self-heating effect by limiting power dissipation in the thermistor to under 100μW, which is good practice. However, the exact maximum current that passes through the NTC is not specified, which leaves uncertainty regarding the control of the self-heating effect.

6. Architecture: The proposed architecture is consistent with the required sensor, linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering, and measurement stages.

The lack of specific details on the linearization optimized for 50 ºC and the omission of the exact maximum current through the NTC are issues that prevent this project from being categorized as optimal. However, these issues do not make the project unfeasible or conceptually incorrect. Therefore, the category is 'acceptable' as the project can be implemented with some adjustments and does not have any fatal flaws.
