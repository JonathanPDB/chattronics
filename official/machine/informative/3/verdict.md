Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary describes an industrial machine monitoring system that includes a pressure sensor array and a temperature sensor array, both requiring amplification and an ADC stage with a minimum sampling rate of 1 kHz per channel, which satisfies the requirement for a sampling frequency of not less than 800 Hz. A multiplexer is mentioned with sufficient data rate and resolution, and it is implied that it is solid state, meeting the requirement for solid state multiplexers.

However, the summary does not explicitly state that the sensors have DC output, which is a critical requirement. The absence of this confirmation could lead to an "incorrect" verdict if the sensors do not indeed have DC output. For the purpose of this review, I will assume the sensors do have DC output, but for a conclusive verdict, this information should be explicitly confirmed.

The pressure sensor array is to be used with an instrumentation amplifier, which is correct according to the requirements. The temperature sensor array mentions linearization methods, including a lookup table, analog linearization circuit, or polynomial linearization, which satisfies the requirement for linearization of infrared radiation sensors.

The anti-aliasing filters are second-order Butterworth low-pass filters with a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz, which satisfies the requirement for the anti-aliasing filter to have a cutoff frequency higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency. However, the summary does not specify the gain of the signal at half the sampling frequency to be at least -20 dB, which is necessary to reduce aliasing effectively.

The project summary also does not detail the sampling order strategy, whether it will be sequential, simultaneous, etc., which is a requirement for a full understanding of the system's operation.

Due to the lack of detail on the DC output of the sensors, the anti-aliasing filter's gain at half the sampling frequency, and the sampling order strategy, the project cannot be classified as "optimal." However, since these issues are not necessarily fatal to the project's implementation, and all other requirements seem to be met or can be reasonably inferred to be met, the project falls into the "acceptable" category.
