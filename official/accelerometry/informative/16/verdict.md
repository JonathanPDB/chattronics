Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The provided design overview for the low-frequency vibration measurement device includes several key components such as the accelerometer, charge amplifier, filters, buffer, and output stage. To assess the project based on the given requirements:

1. The charge amplifier feedback resistance (Rf) and capacitance (Cf) are reported as 25.3 MΩ and 25 pF, respectively. The product Rf * Cf = 25.3 MΩ * 25 pF = 632.5, which is not close to the required 2/pi (approximately 0.637) with an allowable 10% deviation. This does not meet the first requirement.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (Aq) is given as 40,000 V/Coulomb. Using the formula G x 1.61p / Cf, we have (40,000 V/C * 1.61e-12 C/pC) / 25 pF = 2.576e-5, which is far from the required value of roughly around 1 with a permissible 10% difference. Therefore, the second requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly stated in terms of pC but given the accelerometer sensitivity of 100 pC/g and assuming a 1g peak-to-peak input, the output would be 100 pC, not the required 161 pC. This does not satisfy the third requirement.

4 & 5. The bias current is not provided, nor is there a calculation showing that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance equals the bias current. These requirements are essential but have not been addressed in the project design provided.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, fulfilling this requirement.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and includes calculations to back it up, such as the -3 dB point at 0.25 Hz for the feedback resistor. This meets the seventh requirement.

8. The output voltage is designed to be 4V peak, not the required 1V peak-to-peak. This does not meet the eighth requirement.

9. There is no mention of offset voltage, and whether it is kept below 10 mV, therefore this requirement cannot be assessed as fulfilled.

Given these points, the project fails to meet several essential requirements, particularly the first two requirements which are critical for the charge amplifier's function and accuracy. The failure to provide the bias current and the incorrect output voltage further detract from the project's feasibility. Hence, the project cannot be considered optimal, acceptable, or generic and is missing essential design elements, making it unfeasible to implement as it stands.
