The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V\n3. The architecture is simple: there is a voltage divider (with or without a voltage buffer), an anti-aliasing filter and then the DAQ measures the voltage.\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered in 0, for example, +/- 7V.\n5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)\n6. The is a low pass filter (or anti-aliasing filter) that avoids a aliasing\n7. There is a filter removing frequencies between around 50 and 60 Hz\n8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz\n\nYou will categorize the summary into 1 of 5 categories:\n\"optimal\" - use this if the all requirements were reached\n\"acceptable\" - use this category if the project can be implemented and doesn't have any fatal issues, but the score isn't perfect.\n\"generic\" - use this category if the project is theoretically correct and can be implemented, but too generic to have real value.\n\"unfeasible\" - use this if the project is theoretically correct, but contains elements that makes it impossible to implement\n\"incorrect\" - the information provided is conceptually wrong\n\nRequirements marked as essential must be fulfilled in order for a good verdict.\nYou must think as a project designer if the solution is applicable and well thought out.\n\nYou will provide explanations regarding your verdict, the explanations must explicitly indicate which requirements were not reached.\nYou always follow the exact following template in markdown blocks, where all caps words are placeholders for you to fill in.\nInside the verdict placeholder, you will provide only the chosen category.\n\n\n```explanations\nEXPLANATIONS HERE\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nVERDICT_CATEGORY\n```\n\n"

        "content": "Pendulum Angle Measurement System Design\n\nThis design comprises several key components organized into functional blocks: the potentiometer, buffer, anti-alias filter, and ADC. Below is the summary of each block with the suggested components and configurations.\n\nPotentiometer:\n- Type: Linear rotary potentiometer\n- Resistance Range: 10 kOhms\n- Rotational Range: Must match or exceed the pendulum's angular range (45 to 135 degrees)\n- Model Suggestion: Bourns 3590S-2-103L or similar high-resolution potentiometer\n- Power Source: -10 to +10 V, ensuring the output voltage swing matches the DAQ input range\n- Mounting: Must be aligned with the pendulum's pivot to avoid mechanical play or misalignment\n\nBuffer (Voltage Follower):\n- Function: Impedance matching without amplification (Gain = 1)\n- Op-Amp Characteristics: Rail-to-rail output, low offset voltage, low noise\n- Power Supply: Assuming single-supply, use standard voltage like +15V or slightly above the highest expected output from the potentiometer\n- Op-Amp Recommendations: TL072, LM324, or similar\n\nAnti-Alias Filter:\n- Topology: Active Low-Pass Filter, Sallen-Key or Multiple Feedback (MFB)\n- Order: 2nd-order or higher depending on required noise attenuation\n- Cutoff Frequency: 150 Hz recommended to stay well below Nyquist frequency (500 Hz)\n- Filter Type: Butterworth for flat passband response, Chebyshev for steeper roll-off if more critical than passband flatness\n- Component Recommendations: Low-noise op-amps like TL072, OPA2134; 1% tolerance metal film resistors; stable capacitors like MLCC or film capacitors\n- Special Attention: Attenuate 50 and 60 Hz interference\n\nADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter):\n- Resolution: 12-bit (4096 discrete levels) or higher\n- Sampling Rate: 1000 samples per second\n- Input Voltage Range: Bipolar ADC accommodating at least +/-7 V, or unipolar with level shifting and scaling\n- Input Impedance: \u003e= 100 kOhms\n- Digital Interface: SPI or I2C, depending on DAQ/microcontroller interface capabilities\n\nCalculations for each block are based on standard practices and expectations for a pendulum swing measurement application. Specific component values for the filter can be calculated using online tools or filter design software once the final op-amp model and desired cutoff frequency are chosen.\n\nThe design should be compatible with a DAQ system that accepts a voltage range of +/- 7V and has a sampling rate of 1000 sps. Environmental conditions and operational temperatures were not specified; if the pendulum will be used in harsh conditions, the selection of components with appropriate temperature ratings or IP ratings will be required."

    "response": "```explanations\nThe potentiometer is correctly used as a voltage divider and the voltage applied to it is within the specified +/- 10 V range. The buffer is included, which is good practice to prevent loading of the potentiometer. However, the power supply for the op-amp is not specified to be bipolar, which could be an issue since the potentiometer output will be bipolar and the buffer needs to accommodate this.\n\nThe anti-aliasing filter design is generally described well, with considerations for the cutoff frequency, order, and topology. However, the suggestion of a 150 Hz cutoff frequency might not be sufficient to ensure a -20 dB attenuation at 500 Hz, depending on the order of the filter and the filter type's characteristics. More detailed calculations or specifications are needed to determine if the requirement for attenuation at 500 Hz is met.\n\nAdditionally, the summary does not mention a specific filter design for removing frequencies around 50 to 60 Hz, which is a requirement. This could be a notch filter or a band-stop filter, and its absence is a significant oversight.\n\nThe ADC specifications are adequate, with a suitable resolution and sampling rate. The input voltage range is also appropriate, but it is not clear if the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ will be limited to 7V, which is a critical requirement.\n\nOverall, the design is well thought out but lacks some specifics and has a couple of oversights that need to be addressed to meet all the requirements.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
