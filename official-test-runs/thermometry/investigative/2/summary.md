Comprehensive Analog Temperature Measurement System Design

NTC Thermistor Sensor:
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor.
- Operating Temperature Range: 10°C to 90°C.
- Sensor Characteristics: Assumed based on typical NTCLE100E3 series specifications.
- Linearization Resistor: Parallel resistor selected to linearize the thermistor response at the midpoint temperature (50°C), value to be determined based on the datasheet.

Linearization Network:
- Topology: Simple parallel resistor with the NTC thermistor.
- Assumptions: Linearization around the midpoint of temperature range (50°C).
- Resistor: Value close to the thermistor's resistance at 50°C (exact value depends on the thermistor's datasheet).

Amplification Block:
- Topology: Non-inverting amplifier configuration.
- Gain Calculation: Assuming a voltage change of 1V across the temperature range after the voltage divider, to scale this to 20V, a gain of 20 is required.
- Component Selection: If Rg = 1kΩ, then Rf = 19kΩ to set a gain of 20.

Level Shifting:
- Assumptions: Shift an output range of 1-10V from the amplification block up to 0-20V.
- Operational Amplifier: Rail-to-rail op-amp such as LM324 (assuming a single 24V supply).
- Resistors: Precision resistors for setting gain; use potentiometer for fine-tuning during prototyping.

Output Buffer:
- Topology: Non-inverting voltage buffer.
- Operational Amplifier: Rail-to-rail output op-amp, e.g., OPA2277 or AD8675.
- Feedback Resistor (Rf): 100 kΩ.
- Series Output Resistor (Rs): 100 Ω for short-circuit protection.
- Protection Diodes: Schottky diodes, e.g., 1N5819 for overvoltage protection.

Anti-Aliasing Filter:
- Type Order: Second-order (2-pole) Butterworth low-pass filter.
- Cutoff Frequency: 1 Hz.
- Component Selection: For a passive RC filter, R = 159.15 kΩ and C = 1 μF.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
- Type of ADC: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC.
- Resolution: 12-bit to 16-bit.
- Sampling Rate: 1 SPS to 10 SPS.
- Interface Type: SPI or I2C.
- Power Supply Voltage: 3.3V or 5V.
- Accuracy: ±1 LSB.

Additional Notes:
- Calibration: A calibration procedure is recommended for the amplification and level shifting stages to achieve accurate output.
- Protection: Overvoltage and short-circuit protection mechanisms are suggested in the output buffer stage.
- Power Supply: Assumption of power supply voltages is based on common values; exact supply to be determined as per system design.

Design Calculations and Assumptions:
- The gain and component values for the various blocks are based on typical application requirements and may require adjustment during prototyping.
- The linearization resistor value and anti-aliasing filter parameters are critical and should be fine-tuned based on the actual behavior of the thermistor and system requirements.
- The model numbers and component values provided are examples and should be selected based on availability and system constraints.

This summary provides a high-level overview of the system design. Detailed design will require specific information from the components' datasheets and consideration of the final application environment.
