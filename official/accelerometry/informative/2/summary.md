Design of a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Piezoelectric Accelerometer:
- Sensor selection is based on a sensitivity of 100 pC/g.
- Suitable models can include devices such as Endevco 2221F or PCB Piezotronics 352C33.
- Assume a typical capacitance of 10 nF for the piezoelectric sensor for design purposes.

Charge Amplifier:
- A charge amplifier converts the piezoelectric signal to a voltage signal.
- The desired output voltage is 1 V peak-to-peak.
- Assuming a max charge (Q_max) of 1000 pC (from a peak acceleration), the feedback capacitor (C_f) is calculated to be 2 nF.
- Setting the cutoff frequency (f_c) at 0.1 Hz for capturing below 2 Hz, the feedback resistor (R_f) is estimated at 150 kΩ (standard value close to calculated 159 kΩ).

Low-Pass Filter:
- A second-order Sallen-Key topology is suggested.
- The cutoff frequency is conservatively set at 10 Hz to allow the 2 Hz signal to pass while attenuating higher frequencies.
- Component values are chosen to be R1 = R2 = 15.9 kΩ and C1 = C2 = 1 μF for a Butterworth response.
- Quality factor (Q) is set to 1/√2 for a maximally flat passband.

Buffer Amplifier:
- The buffer amplifier provides impedance matching and may offer unity gain or adjustable gain, if necessary.
- The amplifier is required to have a low-frequency response 3 dB down at 0.25 Hz.
- Op-amp selection would be based on the need for high input impedance, low output impedance, and adequate bandwidth.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
- A Sigma-Delta ADC with a resolution of 16 to 24 bits is recommended.
- The sampling rate should be at least 20 Hz (10 times the highest frequency component of 2 Hz).
- SNR should be greater than 90 dB, and the dynamic range should be above 120 dB.
- An external precision voltage reference is recommended.

Digital Signal Processor (DSP):
- Assumed requirements include basic signal analysis, digital filtering, and potentially data storage.
- The processing power must be sufficient to handle the real-time computation of the incoming data stream.

Output Interface:
- The output interface is designed to provide a voltage output of 1 V peak-to-peak.
- A rail-to-rail operational amplifier is recommended for maximizing the dynamic range.
- Implement short-circuit and over-temperature protection for robustness.
- Use low-noise design techniques for signal integrity.
- Include a standardized connector such as BNC or SMA for the output signal.
- EMC-compliant design practices should be considered to prevent interference.

Note: The above component values and specifications are based on typical industry standards and general assumptions made in the absence of detailed project requirements. These are meant to serve as a starting point and should be adjusted to fit the specific needs and constraints of the actual application.
