Analog Temperature Measurement System

Wheatstone Bridge:
- Consists of precision resistors and the NTCLE100E3 thermistor.
- Assumes 10kΩ precision resistors with 1% tolerance and low temperature coefficient.
- Powered by a stable 5V DC source to minimize self-heating and provide good sensitivity.
- Outputs a differential voltage proportional to temperature changes.

Thermistor (NTCLE100E3):
- Typical resistance at 25°C (R25) assumed to be 10kΩ.
- Beta value approximately 3950K.
- Expected to be linearized around the 50°C midpoint.
- Calculated resistance at 50°C using the Beta formula.
- Self-heating effects kept below 1% by designing the bridge circuit with high-value resistors.

Linearization Resistor:
- Assumed to have a resistance similar to the thermistor's resistance at the midpoint temperature (50°C).
- Helps create a linear response of the thermistor within the desired temperature range.
- Value will be fine-tuned based on empirical measurements or the thermistor's datasheet.

Buffer Amplifier:
- Unity-gain operational amplifier configuration.
- Suggested op-amps: OPAx340 or AD8605.
- High input impedance (>1MΩ) to prevent loading the Wheatstone bridge.
- Low output impedance (<100Ω) to drive subsequent stages.
- Single supply voltage assumed to be at least 24V to accommodate 0-20V output range.

Differential Amplifier:
- Instrumentation amplifier topology with high CMRR.
- Gain of 200 to map the estimated Wheatstone bridge output (10mV to 100mV) to the 0-20V output range.
- Low noise op-amp selection, possible choice: AD620.
- Low-pass filter may be included to reduce high-frequency noise.
- Power supply assumed to be ±15V for dual supply operation.

Gain Stage:
- Non-inverting operational amplifier configuration with a gain of 200.
- Feedback resistor (Rf) 199 kΩ and input resistor (Rg) 1 kΩ for the estimated gain.
- Rail-to-rail output op-amp suggested if using a single supply.
- Capacitor added in parallel with Rf for noise reduction if needed.

Low-Pass Filter:
- Second-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a Butterworth response for flat passband.
- Cutoff frequency selected at 10 Hz to attenuate high-frequency noise and prevent aliasing.
- Standard capacitor value C1 = C2 = 1.5 μF (or closest available value) based on a 10 kΩ resistance for the filter design.
- Low-noise operational amplifier, such as the LM358 or OPA2134, used in the filter design.

Output Stage (0-20V):
- Non-inverting operational amplifier to provide level shifting and amplification.
- Feedback resistor Rf = 90kΩ and input resistor Ri = 10kΩ assuming a gain of 10.
- Overvoltage and short-circuit protection implemented using diodes such as 1N4148.
- Series resistance Rs = 100Ω and output capacitance Co = 10μF for output filtering.
- Power supply assumed to be a +24V single-ended or ±15V dual supply.

The entire solution is designed to be robust, accurate, and capable of providing a 0-20V output voltage range for temperature measurements with the NTCLE100E3 thermistor, with careful consideration given to linearization, amplification, filtering, and protection.
