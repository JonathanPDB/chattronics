Score: 6
Explanations: 
1. The potentiometer is part of a voltage divider in the attenuator stage.
2. The power supply for the buffer stage is +/-12V, which is likely to be the voltage applied to the potentiometer as well.
3. The system architecture includes a voltage divider, a low-pass filter, and a DAQ system, as described.
4. The attenuator is designed to scale the voltage to +/- 7V for the DAQ input.
5. The attenuator's design ensures that the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V.
6. There is a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 40 Hz, which would help reduce aliasing.
7. The low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 40 Hz is designed to eliminate power line noise, which typically occurs around 50 and 60 Hz.
8. The filter order is second-order, which does not meet the requirement of at least a third-order filter.

The project summary does not explicitly state the voltage applied to the potentiometer, and we cannot assume it is +/-10V based on the buffer stage power supply. Additionally, the filter order is only second-order, which does not satisfy the minimum requirement of a third-order filter.
