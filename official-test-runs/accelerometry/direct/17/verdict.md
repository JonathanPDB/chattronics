Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The provided project summary outlines the design of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device, which includes a charge mode piezoelectric accelerometer, a charge amplifier, a low-pass filter, output stage amplification, digital processing components, and a microcontroller. However, to assess the project's compliance with the requirements provided, we need to analyze the design against each specific requirement:

1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and capacitance (C_f) in the charge amplifier are given as 1 MΩ and 10 nF, respectively. The product R_f * C_f is 1 MΩ * 10 nF = 10 s. However, the requirement is that R_f * C_f must be around 2/pi (~0.637 s), allowing up to a 10% difference. This value is significantly off, and thus, this requirement is not met.

2. The charge amplifier gain (G) multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (C_f) should be roughly around 1. The provided gain is 156.25 MV/C, and C_f is 10 nF. The calculated value is G * 1.61E-12 / C_f = 156.25E6 * 1.61E-12 / 10E-9 = 2.515625, which is more than double the target, so this requirement is also not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated based on the sensor sensitivity and the expected vibration amplitude. However, the provided information does not specify the peak-to-peak charge output, so this requirement cannot be assessed.

4. Bias current must be provided, but the design summary does not provide explicit information regarding the bias current for the JFET input operational amplifier.

5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (R_f) must equal the bias current is not addressed in the summary, as the bias current is not specified.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which meets this requirement.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, but the summary does not provide detailed calculations to back up the optimization, so this requirement cannot be fully assessed.

8. The output voltage is specified to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets this requirement.

9. The offset voltage should be kept below 10 mV, but there is no information provided about the offset voltage in the design.

Due to the lack of compliance with several critical requirements, particularly the charge amplifier feedback time constant and gain/capacitance ratio, as well as insufficient details on peak-to-peak charge output, bias current, and offset voltage, the project cannot be categorized as optimal or acceptable. The design is theoretically correct in terms of the fundamental concepts of a charge amplifier and low-frequency vibration measurement, but the lack of compliance with the essential requirements means the design is not feasible as it stands.
