Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water Beaker

This summary outlines the design and implementation details for an analog temperature measurement system using a Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor to measure the temperature of water in a beaker and provide an output voltage readable by a multimeter.

Thermistor Sensor Block:
- Sensor Type: NTC thermistor (Vishay NTCLE100E3 or equivalent with similar characteristics)
- Measurement Range: 10°C to 90°C
- Circuit Configuration: Voltage divider with NTC thermistor as one leg
- Fixed Resistor: Precision resistor, value chosen to match the thermistor's resistance at the midpoint temperature (50°C) for optimal sensitivity
- Self-Heating Effect: Minimized by choosing a high-value fixed resistor to limit current through the thermistor
- Calibration: One-time calibration against a known temperature standard

Signal Conditioning Block:
- Topology: Wheatstone bridge and operational amplifier (op-amp) for linear voltage output
- Resistors: Match resistance of thermistor at 50°C, standard value close to 10kΩ
- Op-amp: Choose rail-to-rail op-amp, such as LM358 or LM324, depending on supply voltage
- Gain Adjustment: Potentiometer in feedback loop to calibrate voltage range

Amplification Block:
- Op-Amp Configuration: Non-inverting amplifier
- Precision Op-Amp: LM358, AD8605, or equivalent
- Gain: 10 (adjustable using a potentiometer for R2)
- Power Supply: 12V to 15V, single supply
- Protection: Overvoltage protection diodes

Anti-Aliasing Filter (If ADC is used):
- Topology: Active Low-Pass Filter
- Filter Type: 2nd Order Butterworth
- Cutoff Frequency: 10 Hz
- Component Values: C1 = C2 = 10 nF, R1 = R2 = 1.6 kΩ (standard value close to 1.59 kΩ)
- Op-Amp: Low-noise precision type, suitable for the selected power supply

Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) Block (If digitization is required):
- Type of ADC: Successive Approximation Register (SAR)
- Resolution: 10 to 12 bits depending on precision needed
- Sampling Rate: 1 to 10 samples per second
- Interface: Common serial interfaces like SPI or I2C
- Reference Voltage: Internal, or external for higher accuracy

Output Block:
- Voltage Divider: Connect fixed resistor and thermistor in series
- Voltage Measurement: Use a high-quality multimeter capable of millivolt resolution, setting the multimeter to measure DC voltage
- Connection to Multimeter: Standard cables, e.g., banana plug to alligator clip or BNC connectors
- Calibration: Document voltage readings along with reference temperatures for accuracy

The above components and configurations provide a basic framework for an analog temperature measurement system. Actual component values and configurations may require adjustment based on specifics of the thermistor used and the desired accuracy. Calibration procedures and precise component selection are crucial for achieving the desired measurement accuracy.
