Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water Beaker

The system is designed to measure the temperature of water inside a beaker using a Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor and output a voltage that can be measured by a multimeter within a 0-20V range. The temperature measurement range is from 10 to 90 degrees Celsius, and self-heating is to be less than 1%.

Thermistor Sensor Block:
- Sensor Type: NTC Vishay NTCLE100E3 Thermistor
- Assumed Resistance at 25°C (R25): 10k ohms
- Assumed Beta Value (β): 3950K
- Series Resistor: Selected to limit the current and minimize self-heating. For a 10k ohm thermistor, a value between 100k ohms to 1M ohms is suggested, depending on the excitation voltage.

Linearization Network:
- Objective: To linearize the thermistor response around 50 degrees Celsius.
- Parallel Resistor (Rp): Chosen to match the resistance of the thermistor at 50 degrees Celsius. Assuming a resistance of around 3.3k ohms, Rp is also set to 3.3k ohms with a tolerance of 1% or better.

Amplification Stage:
- Topology: Non-Inverting Operational Amplifier Configuration
- Operational Amplifier: General-purpose precision op-amp with rail-to-rail output (e.g., Texas Instruments OPAx177 or equivalent)
- Power Supply: ±15 V dual supply assumed
- Gain Calculation: Assuming the sensor provides a 0 to 5 V output, a gain of 4 is required to achieve 0 to 20 V output. Using non-inverting amplifier gain formula: A_v = 1 + (R_f / R_i), with R_i = 10 kΩ, R_f is set to 30 kΩ.

Output Scaling & Buffer:
- Topology: Non-Inverting Amplifier for Scaling, Unity Gain Buffer for Output
- Operational Amplifier: TL071 or equivalent for low noise and high input impedance
- Resistor Values: Based on an assumed Vmax_linearization of 1V, R1 = 180kΩ (for real gain of 19), R2 = 10kΩ.
- No additional scaling is required if the amplifier's gain is set to fulfill the output voltage range. A buffer stage will be implemented if necessary to provide a low impedance output.

Output to Multimeter:
- Use a high-quality digital multimeter (DMM) with a high input impedance (10 Mohms or more), high resolution (0.1mV or better), and sufficient bandwidth to capture the DC voltage level.
- If data logging is required, select a DMM with data logging capabilities or with an interface for external logging.
- The multimeter should be set to the appropriate voltage range and connected to the output terminals using shielded cables to minimize noise and interference.

Overall, ensure that the selected components are compatible with each other and the power supply voltages. The final design should be verified through experimentation and fine-tuning to match the specific requirements and characteristics of the components used.
