Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water Beaker

The system measures the temperature of water in a beaker using a Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor and outputs a voltage ranging from 0 to 20 Volts corresponding to the temperature range of 10 to 90 degrees Celsius. Here is a summary of the architecture blocks and their details:

NTC Thermistor (NTCLE100E3)
- Nominal resistance (R25): Typically 10kΩ
- Beta value (B-constant): Assumed around 3950K for calculations

Wheatstone Bridge
- Resistors R1, R3: 10kΩ (fixed precision resistors)
- Thermistor R2: NTCLE100E3 (changes with temperature)
- Resistor R4: 10kΩ or adjustable with potentiometer for bridge balancing
- Operating voltage: Assumed 5V for the bridge
- Output voltage swing: Designed to be 0V to 4V based on thermistor resistance changes

Buffer Amplifier
- A voltage follower using a general-purpose op-amp (e.g., LM324 or TL074)
- Unity gain (Gain = 1)
- Low output impedance to drive subsequent stages
- High input impedance to avoid loading the Wheatstone bridge
- Single supply voltage: Assumed 5V to 15V

Differential Amplifier
- Gain set by resistors or potentiometer (Rf/Rin)
- Gain approximately 200 to achieve a 0 to 20V output from a millivolt-level input
- Precision op-amp like the AD620 for high CMRR

Gain Stage
- Non-inverting amplifier configuration
- Gain calculated to map the bridge voltage (0V to 4V) to 0 to 20V output
- Potential component values: R1 (feedback) = 199kΩ, R2 (input) = 1kΩ
- Gain (Av) = 1 + (R1/R2)

Low-pass Filter
- First-order passive RC low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz (assuming a 1 kΩ resistor): Capacitor C = 159.15 μF
- Second-order active Butterworth low-pass filter (Sallen-Key Design) as an alternative for better noise rejection, with a lower cutoff frequency (e.g., 0.1 Hz) if needed

Output Voltage Measurement
- Measurement using a high-resolution digital multimeter (DMM) capable of voltage readings up to 20 Volts with at least 4 1/2 to 6 1/2 digit resolution
- Connection using shielded cables to minimize noise
- Ambient conditions stabilized to avoid fluctuations in the signal
- Calibration of the DMM according to manufacturer's specifications

The design of each block is based on assumptions made in the absence of specific user inputs. The component values and operating parameters provided are for a generic application and would need to be refined based on further details or experimentation during the prototyping phase.
