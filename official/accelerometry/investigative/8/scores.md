Score: 3
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) of 300 MÎ© and feedback capacitance (Cf) of 1 nF gives a product of 300e6 * 1e-9 = 0.3, which is not close to 2/pi (approximately 0.637). This does not meet the requirement.
2. The gain of the charge amplifier (10 V/nC) times 1.61e-12 (1.61 pC) divided by the feedback capacitance (1 nF) would be 10 * 1.61e-12 / 1e-9 = 1.61e-2, which is not close to 1. This does not meet the requirement.
3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated using the sensitivity of 100 pC/g and the given peak amplification of 5 cm, but without the mass or acceleration, this cannot be verified. Therefore, this requirement is not explicitly met in the summary.
4. The bias current is not explicitly provided in the project summary.
5. The inverse of the feedback resistance (Rf) is 1/300e6 = 3.33e-9, which is supposed to equal the bias current. However, since the bias current is not provided, this requirement cannot be verified.
6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is clearly stated in the overview.
7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, and calculations are provided to back it up, including the selection of the high-pass cutoff frequency and the design of the low-pass filter.
8. The output voltage is designed to be 1 V peak-to-peak, as indicated in the charge amplifier gain calculations.
9. The offset voltage is not mentioned in the summary, so it cannot be confirmed if it is kept below 10 mV.

The requirements that are clearly met are 6, 7, and 8.
