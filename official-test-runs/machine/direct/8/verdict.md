Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary provided for the Pressure and Temperature Monitoring System Design outlines a comprehensive system that includes pressure and temperature sensors, amplification stages, multiplexing, signal conditioning, anti-aliasing filtering, and analog-to-digital conversion, meeting many of the requirements specified. However, there are some issues to address:

1. Both sensors have d.c. output, and no demodulation is used – this requirement is met.
2. Both sensors are amplified – this requirement is met with the use of instrumentation amplifiers for pressure sensors and voltage amplifiers for temperature sensors.
3. The pressure sensor is in a Wheatstone bridge and amplified by an instrumentation amplifier – this requirement is met.
4. An ADC is used – this requirement is met with a specified SAR ADC with a resolution of 12-bit.
5. Infrared radiation sensors are being linearized – this requirement is met with the implementation of a polynomial correction circuit for the temperature sensors.
6. The sampling order strategy is not explicitly mentioned – this requirement is not fully met as the summary does not specify whether the sampling is sequential or simultaneous.
7. The ADC's sampling frequency is at least 800 Hz – this requirement is met, with a specified sampling rate of at least 2 kHz per channel.
8. The anti-aliasing filter's specifications meet the requirement of at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency – this requirement is met with a stopband attenuation of at least 48 dB by the first octave above the cutoff (800 Hz).
9. The low pass cutoff frequency is between 400 Hz and less than half the total sampling frequency – this requirement is met, as the cutoff frequency is specified at 400 Hz.
10. Low-pass filters are positioned before the multiplexer(s) – this requirement is met as the anti-aliasing filter is mentioned, though the exact positioning is not specified.
11. Multiplexer(s) are used – this requirement is met with the inclusion of a 16-channel analog multiplexer.
12. Multiplexers are solid-state – this requirement is met with the specified CD74HC4067.

The only minor shortfall is the lack of detail on the sampling order strategy; however, this does not constitute a fatal flaw and can be easily addressed in the implementation phase. Overall, the project meets all essential requirements and can be considered well thought out and applicable.
