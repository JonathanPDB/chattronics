Since the potentiometer is linear, the voltage output will be directly proportional to the angle of the pendulum. Given the angle range from 45 to 135 degrees, with 90 degrees being the steady position, the voltage output range of the potentiometer will be from -5 V to 5 V, correlating to the middle range of the potentiometer's total possible output. This output range is within the maximum accepted input voltage for the DAQ, which is +/- 7 V.
