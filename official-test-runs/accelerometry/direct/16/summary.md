Design of a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Piezoelectric Accelerometer:
- Type: Charge mode piezoelectric accelerometer
- Sensitivity: 100 pC/g
- Expected peak acceleration: 0.079577 g (calculated from the peak amplitude of 5 cm at 2 Hz)
- Recommended model: PCB Piezotronics 352C33 (or equivalent)
- Environmental Conditions: Wide operating temperature range (e.g., -40°C to +85°C) and hermetically sealed for protection against humidity
- Mounting: Secure mounting compatible with portable device design, shielded cabling for noise reduction

Charge Amplifier:
- Operational Amplifier: FET input op-amp (e.g., TL071, AD712, LF356) for high input impedance and low offset voltage
- Feedback Capacitor (C_f): 1 nF for low reactance at low frequencies
- Feedback Resistor (R_f): Selected to achieve a cutoff frequency at 0.25 Hz
- Calculated R_f ≈ 636.62 kΩ, standard value chosen is 620 kΩ
- Gain (A_v) with chosen R_f: 620 kΩ / 1 nF = 620 V/µC
- Power Supply: ±15 V for operational amplifier
- Shielding and grounding to minimize interference

Low-Pass Filter:
- Type: Active Butterworth filter topology for maximally flat frequency response
- Order: Fourth-order (24 dB/octave roll-off)
- Cutoff Frequency (f_c): Designed with f_c at 0.25 Hz as per system requirements
- Implementation: Two cascaded second-order Sallen-Key sections using operational amplifiers
- Component values to be determined based on the chosen operational amplifiers and standardized passive component values

Output Amplifier:
- Topology: Non-Inverting Operational Amplifier configuration
- Gain Calculation: Target gain of 200 to achieve 1 V peak-to-peak output from the 5.1 mV peak output of the charge amplifier
- Gain Setting Resistors: Rf = 199 kΩ (feedback resistor), R1 = 1 kΩ (grounding resistor)
- Operational Amplifier: Low input offset voltage amplifier (e.g., OPA227, AD8628) to maintain the offset voltage less than 10 mV
- Power Supply: Dual power supply (e.g., ±5V or ±15V) recommended

ADC (Optional):
- Resolution: 12-bit resolution adequate for vibration measurements
- Sampling Rate: Minimum of 20 samples per second (20 Hz) suggested for capturing the waveform accurately
- ADC Topology: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC for balance between speed, cost, and power
- Input Signal Range: 0 to 1 V or ±0.5 V depending on unipolar or bipolar ADC
- Communication Interface: SPI protocol for microcontroller interfacing
- Power Supply: 3.3 V or 5 V, considering battery power constraints

Anti-Aliasing Filter (If ADC is used):
- ADC Sampling Rate Assumption: 100 Hz (25 times the signal frequency)
- Filter Type: Fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter for minimal passband ripple
- Cutoff Frequency: Set at 20 Hz to ensure significant attenuation by the Nyquist frequency (50 Hz)
- Components: Low-noise, FET-input operational amplifiers and high-quality passive components

Output Stage:
- Functionality: Capable of driving various loads and interfacing with different output devices
- Voltage Follower or Buffer Amplifier: To ensure low output impedance and accurate signal transmission
- Options: Isolation amplifier if required for noise immunity or safety considerations
- Power Supply: Considerations for battery operation and low power consumption

General Design Considerations:
- All stages should use high-quality, precision components to ensure accuracy and stability
- Shielding and proper grounding practices should be employed throughout the design
- Power supply decoupling should be used to minimize noise in all active stages
- For battery-powered designs, low quiescent current components and power-down modes should be considered to extend battery life

This summary provides an overview of the architecture blocks and critical component specifications for the portable vibration measurement device. The exact values and models may need to be adjusted based on component availability and additional design constraints encountered in the implementation phase.
