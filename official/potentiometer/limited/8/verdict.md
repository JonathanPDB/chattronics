Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System generally meets several of the key requirements, but there are some issues that need to be addressed.

- The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, which aligns with the first requirement.
- The +/- 10V voltage applied to the potentiometer meets the second requirement.
- The architecture includes a voltage divider, a buffer amplifier, a level shifter, notch filters, an anti-aliasing filter, and a gain stage before the DAQ, which is somewhat more complex than the simple architecture described in the third requirement. However, this complexity may be justified by the need to meet the other requirements.
- The level shifter is designed to adjust the voltage range to fit within the DAQ's +/- 7V input range, which aligns with the fourth requirement.
- The notch filters and the anti-aliasing filter are included, which is consistent with the sixth and seventh requirements to avoid aliasing and remove 50-60 Hz frequencies.
- The filter's cutoff frequency is set just below 500 Hz, and a second-order Butterworth filter is used, which should ensure that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, complying with the eighth requirement.

However, there are potential issues:
- The gain stage is set to a gain of 0.65, but no justification is provided for this value. This could be problematic if the resulting signal does not utilize the full range of the DAQ's input voltage.
- It is not clear if the anti-aliasing filter's gain at 500 Hz is at least -20 dB, as the exact cutoff frequency and order of the filter are not specified.
- The level shifter design does not seem to be centered at 0V, which could be an issue if the DAQ requires a centered input voltage.

These issues need to be addressed in order for the project to fully meet the specified requirements.
