Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) must be around 2/pi. The project provides Rf = 2.7 MΩ and Cf = 240 pF. The product Rf*Cf is 2.7e6 * 240e-12 = 648e-6, which is approximately 0.648. The value 2/pi is approximately 0.637. The difference is around 1.7%, which is within the 10% tolerance.

2. The charge amplifier gain multiplied by 1.61e-12 and divided by Cf should be around 1. With a gain (G) of approximately 2.58e6 V/C, G * 1.61e-12 / Cf = 2.58e6 * 1.61e-12 / 240e-12 ≈ 1.74, which is not within the 10% tolerance. This requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak output charge is calculated to be around 387.63 pC, which is not within the 10% tolerance of the required 161 pC. This requirement is not met.

4. The bias current is not explicitly provided in the summary. This requirement is not met.

5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current cannot be evaluated because the bias current is not provided. This requirement is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor. This requirement is met.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, and calculations are provided to support this. This requirement is met.

8. The output voltage is designed to be 1 V peak to peak. This requirement is met.

9. The offset should be kept below 10 mV, but the project summary does not provide explicit information about the offset voltage. Therefore, this requirement cannot be evaluated based on the given information.
