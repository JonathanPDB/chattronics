Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary presents a comprehensive analog temperature measurement system with a focus on using an NTC thermistor as the temperature sensor. The following points address the requirements:

1. The output is measured by a high-impedance digital multimeter capable of measuring up to 20V, which satisfies the requirement for output measurement.
2. An amplification stage with a non-inverting amplifier configuration is included, and the gain is calculated to be approximately 20, which is justified based on the maximum output voltage and sensor output.
3. The output voltage range is specified to be 0-20V, which meets the requirement.
4. A linearization resistor is chosen to match the thermistor resistance at a 50Â°C midpoint, which implies that the linearization of the NTC is considered for the midrange temperature.
5. The linearization of the NTC is critical, and the summary indicates that the resistor was calculated to achieve this, although the actual linearization effectiveness is not demonstrated through equations or graphs.
6. The architecture consists of a sensor (NTC), linearization stage, buffer, amplification, level shifting, and optional anti-aliasing filter, which is in line with the required system structure.
7. The sensor used is an NTC thermistor, which is a mandatory requirement.
8. The self-heating effect is addressed by operating the NTC at a current below 0.5mA, which indicates consideration of the maximum current through the NTC.

While the summary does not explicitly demonstrate the effectiveness of the linearization through a practical demonstration, it does indicate that a specific linearization approach was taken. Therefore, assuming the linearization is effective in practice, the project appears to meet the essential requirements. However, without empirical evidence or detailed calculations showing the linearization effectiveness, it is difficult to categorically state that the NTC is perfectly linearized, which is a critical aspect of the project.
