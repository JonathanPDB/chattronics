Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The presented design of the low-frequency vibration measurement device addresses several of the provided requirements, but there are some discrepancies and missing information that prevent a verdict of "optimal":

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and capacitance (Cf) values should give a time constant (τ = Rf * Cf) roughly around 2/pi. The provided values result in τ = 620 kΩ * 1 nF = 620 μs. The target time constant should be approximately 0.637 μs, so the design does not meet the requirement within the allowed 10% difference.
2. The charge amplifier gain (G) multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (Cf) should be roughly around 1. With the given values, G * 1.61E-12 / Cf = 10^7 V/C * 1.61E-12 / 1E-9 F ≈ 16.1, which is significantly off from the requirement.
3. There is no mention of the peak-to-peak charge output. The requirement is 161 pC, but without this information, we cannot assess whether the design meets this specification.
4. There is no mention of the bias current or how it is provided.
5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current is not addressed in the design.
6. The use of a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor is consistent with the project requirements.
7. The design is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, and calculations are provided to back this up.
8. The output voltage is specified as 1 V peak-to-peak, which meets the requirement.
9. There is no mention of the offset voltage, so we cannot confirm if it is kept below 10 mV.

Due to the failure to meet several critical requirements, particularly those involving the charge amplifier's time constant, gain, and the lack of information on peak-to-peak charge output and bias current, the design cannot be considered "optimal" or "acceptable." The design is "theoretically correct" in terms of the basic concepts of a charge amplifier and low-frequency vibration measurement, but it is missing essential elements and has significant issues that make it impossible to implement as described. Therefore, the verdict is "unfeasible."
