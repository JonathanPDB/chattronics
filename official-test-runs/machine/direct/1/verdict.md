Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project description covers an analog instrumentation system for pressure and temperature monitoring, which includes the use of strain-gauge pressure sensors and infrared radiation detectors. The system is designed to amplify signals from both types of sensors and process them through low-pass filters and multiplexers before analog-to-digital conversion.

The following requirements are addressed and fulfilled:
1. Both sensors have d.c. output, so no demodulation is used.
2. Both sensors are amplified.
3. The pressure sensor is inserted in a Wheatstone bridge and amplified by an instrumentation amplifier.
4. An ADC is used in the design.
5. Infrared radiation sensors are being linearized, although the method is assumed to be general-purpose due to lack of specifics.
6. The solution mentions an integrated 16 single-ended input MUX in the ADC, which implies a sequential sampling strategy.
7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is not less than 800 Hz. In fact, it's 6400 Hz (800 Hz per channel x 8 channels).
8. The anti-aliasing filter is included before the ADC, but there's no specific gain at half the sampling frequency mentioned.
9. The low-pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency.
10. There are low-pass filters positioned before the multiplexers to reduce aliasing.
11. Multiplexers are used to choose channels.
12. The multiplexers mentioned are solid-state devices.

The project seems to be missing a detailed explanation on the anti-aliasing filter's performance at half the sampling frequency. There is no mention of whether the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency, which is necessary to ensure adequate signal attenuation and prevent aliasing.

While the low-pass cutoff frequency of 400 Hz is mentioned, it is not explicitly stated that this is higher than half the total sampling frequency, which should be at least 3200 Hz (half of 6400 Hz) to satisfy requirement 9. Since the cutoff frequency is 400 Hz, this would not satisfy the requirement if the total sampling frequency were indeed 6400 Hz, as the cutoff frequency would need to be less than 3200 Hz.

The lack of clarity on these two points prevents the project from being categorized as "optimal". The project otherwise appears to meet the necessary requirements and can be implemented with the provided information, suggesting that it is "acceptable" rather than "optimal".
