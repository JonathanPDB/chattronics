Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary describes a water temperature measurement system using an NTC thermistor, with subsequent stages for linearization, buffering, amplification, and filtering. The following points are addressed:

1. The output is measured by a multimeter, which is consistent with the requirement.
2. An amplification stage with a gain of 10 is provided, which seems reasonable to amplify a presumed 0-2V signal to a 0-20V range, although the justification for the gain value could be more detailed.
3. The output voltage range (0 to 20 Volts) is suitable for measurement by a multimeter.
4. A parallel resistor is used to linearize the NTC thermistor at the midpoint temperature of 50°C, which is a common approach for improving linearity.
5. The project mentions the use of an NTC thermistor and linearization, fulfilling the requirement for sensor type and linearization necessity.
6. The architecture generally follows the required sensor, linearization, amplification, optional filtering, and measurement stages.
7. The sensor used is an NTC thermistor, which is mandatory for this project.
8. Self-heating is addressed by operating the NTC in the microampere range, which implies that self-heating effects are considered.

However, there are some areas that could be improved or clarified:
- The exact model of the NTC thermistor should be specified to ensure that the linearization and amplification stages are accurately designed for the specific characteristics of the sensor.
- The justification for the gain value could be more detailed to ensure that it is appropriate for the entire temperature range and not just the midpoint.
- The linearization network should have a more detailed explanation on how it improves linearity over the entire temperature range, not just at 50°C.

While the project meets the essential requirements, some aspects could be better detailed to ensure optimal performance across the entire temperature range. Therefore, the project is marked as "acceptable" as it can be implemented without any fatal issues but could benefit from further optimization.
