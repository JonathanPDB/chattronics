        "content": "Pendulum Angle Measurement System Design\n\nThe project involves designing an analog system to measure the angle of a pendulum using a 10 kOhm linear potentiometer with a power source varying between -10 and 10 Volts. The DAQ system samples at 1000 samples per second and accepts a maximum input voltage of +/- 7 V.\n\nPotentiometer:\n- Model: Bourns 3590S-2-103L or equivalent.\n- Characteristics: 10 kOhm linear taper, 2 W power rating at 70°C, operating temperature range of -55°C to +125°C.\n\nOffset Adjustment:\n- Configuration: Differential Amplifier using an operational amplifier (Op-Amp).\n- Gain (Av): Set to 7/10 to match the potentiometer output to DAQ input range.\n- Resistor Values: Assuming R1 = 10 kOhms, R2 should be 7 kOhms.\n\nAmplifier:\n- Configuration: Non-inverting operational amplifier.\n- Gain (A): Approximate gain of 1.4 to scale the potentiometer voltage to the DAQ's input range.\n- Resistor Values: R1 = 10 kOhms, R2 = 3.9 kOhms (chosen from standard values for a gain slightly less than 1.4).\n\nFilter_50Hz and Filter_60Hz (Assumed similar requirements for both filters):\n- Type: Active Band-Stop (Notch) Filter.\n- Center Frequency (f0): 50 Hz and 60 Hz respectively.\n- Quality Factor (Q): 10 for 50 Hz filter, 30 for 60 Hz filter.\n- Attenuation Level: At least -20 dB for 50 Hz and -30 dB for 60 Hz at their respective center frequencies.\n- Op-Amp: TL072 or similar low-noise operational amplifier.\n\nAnti-Aliasing Filter:\n- Type: Active Low-Pass Sallen-Key Filter.\n- Order: Second-order.\n- Cut-off Frequency: 150 Hz.\n- Op-Amp: TL072 or similar.\n- Quality Factor (Q): 0.707 for a Butterworth response.\n- Resistors/Capacitors: Values calculated based on standard Sallen-Key formulas to achieve the desired cut-off frequency and response.\n\nOverall Architecture:\n1. The Potentiometer acts as a transducer, measuring the pendulum's angle and converting it into a voltage signal.\n2. The Offset Adjustment block scales the potentiometer's output to fit the DAQ's input voltage range.\n3. The Amplifier block adjusts the signal amplitude, ensuring it does not exceed the DAQ's maximum voltage input.\n4. The Filter_50Hz and Filter_60Hz blocks remove power line noise from the signal.\n5. The Anti-Aliasing Filter prevents high-frequency noise from creating artifacts in the digital signal post-ADC conversion.\n6. The DAQ samples the conditioned analog signal at 1000 samples per second, converting it to a digital representation for analysis."

    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary covers the following requirements:\n\n1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider - The summary implies this as it mentions the potentiometer is used to measure the pendulum's angle, which is a common application of potentiometers as voltage dividers.\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V - This is explicitly stated in the project description.\n3. The architecture is simple with a voltage divider, an anti-aliasing filter, and then the DAQ measures the voltage - The overall architecture follows this simplicity.\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, +/- 7V - The offset adjustment and amplifier blocks ensure the signal fits the DAQ's input voltage range.\n5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V - The gain setting of the differential amplifier (7/10) and the non-inverting amplifier gain (slightly less than 1.4) ensure that the output does not exceed +/- 7V.\n6. There is a low pass filter (or anti-aliasing filter) that avoids aliasing - An active low-pass Sallen-Key filter with a cut-off frequency of 150 Hz is used for anti-aliasing.\n7. There is a filter removing frequencies between around 50 and 60 Hz - Active band-stop (notch) filters at both 50 Hz and 60 Hz are used to remove power line noise.\n8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz - This is not explicitly stated. While there is mention of attenuation at the center frequencies of the notch filters, there is no information on the gain at 500 Hz. Without further details, we cannot confirm that the gain at 500 Hz meets the -20 dB requirement.\n\nThe requirements that are not explicitly covered are:\n8. The gain at 500 Hz has not been specified, so we cannot confirm if it is at least -20 dB.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can confirm 7 out of 8 requirements are met.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n7\n```",
