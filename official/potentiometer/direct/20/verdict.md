Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project described for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System Design appears to have addressed the majority of the requirements. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider and is specified to handle the required voltage range of +/- 10V. The scaling amplifier block is designed to scale the potentiometer's output to the DAQ's required input voltage range of +/- 7V, meeting the essential requirement that the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V. The inclusion of both a band-stop filter and an anti-aliasing filter suggests that the project is designed to avoid aliasing and remove unwanted frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz. However, the anti-aliasing filter is specified with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz and a filter order of 4th, which may not guarantee a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz without further information on the filter's attenuation rate. While the design seems theoretically sound, the lack of detailed information on the anti-aliasing filter's performance at 500 Hz leaves some uncertainty regarding this specific requirement. Nonetheless, the project can be implemented and does not have any fatal issues, but the score isn't perfect due to the potential uncertainty in meeting the -20 dB gain requirement at 500 Hz.
