Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design summary addresses most of the requirements for the pendulum angle measurement system. The potentiometer is utilized as a voltage divider and is suitable for the mechanical range of the pendulum. A voltage follower is used to buffer the signal, which is common in analog design to prevent loading effects. The inclusion of a 4th order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff of 5 Hz exceeds the requirement to filter out 50 and 60 Hz noise, providing over 40 dB of attenuation at these frequencies. The anti-aliasing filter with a 100 Hz cutoff is appropriate for the DAQ's sampling rate.

However, there are some issues to address:
- The scaling factor for the voltage scaler is correct to ensure the DAQ's input voltage does not exceed +/- 7V, but it is not clear if the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ will be strictly limited to 7V under all conditions, which is a critical requirement.
- The anti-aliasing filter is specified with a 100 Hz cutoff frequency, which may not guarantee the -20 dB gain at 500 Hz as required. The order and cutoff frequency of this filter should be chosen to meet this specification.
- There is no explicit mention of the DAQ's input voltage centering around 0V, which is a requirement.
- The summary suggests that the anti-aliasing ensures the maximum pendulum motion frequency is below 500 Hz, but this does not directly relate to the requirement of having at least -20 dB gain at 500 Hz.

Given these points, the project has potential but needs adjustments to fully meet the requirements.
