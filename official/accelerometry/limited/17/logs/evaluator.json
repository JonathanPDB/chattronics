    "response": "```explanations\nThe provided project summary covers the following:\n\n1. The feedback resistance and capacitance for the charge amplifier are given as R_f = 1 MΩ and C_f = 10 nF. The product of these values is R_f * C_f = 1e6 * 1e-8 = 0.1 s. The requirement states that R_f * C_f should be roughly around 2/pi (≈0.637), which is not the case here; 0.1 s is significantly different from 0.637 s.\n\n2. The charge amplifier's gain (G) is stated to be 156.25 MV/C. Using the formula G * 1.61E-12 / C_f, we get 156.25E6 * 1.61E-12 / 10E-9 = 0.025. This is not roughly around 1, therefore this requirement is not met.\n\n3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that the system is designed to convert a 6.4 pC peak charge to a 1 Vpp output. This does not match the requirement of a 161 pC peak-to-peak charge output.\n\n4. The bias current is not provided explicitly. The requirement for the bias current is not met.\n\n5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current cannot be evaluated due to the absence of the bias current information. Thus, this requirement is not met.\n\n6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is stated in the summary. This requirement is met.\n\n7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude. This requirement is met, as the sensor type and model are appropriate for this range, and the low-pass filter is designed with a cutoff frequency that accommodates the low-frequency response.\n\n8. The output voltage is stated to be 1 V peak to peak. This requirement is met.\n\n9. The offset voltage should be kept below 10 mV. Since there is no mention of the offset voltage in the project summary, this requirement cannot be confirmed as met.\n\nIn summary, the project meets requirements 6, 7, and 8 but does not meet the others based on the provided information.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n3\n```",
