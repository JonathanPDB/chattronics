Verdict: incorrect

Explanations: 
The design presented for the Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device includes detailed considerations for the sensor, charge amplifier, low-pass filter, ADC, and microcontroller/DSP blocks. The calculations provided give insight into the design rationale and component selection.

However, there are discrepancies and missing information regarding the specific requirements:

1. The feedback resistance and capacitance for the charge amplifier to achieve a time constant of roughly 2/pi are not specified. Without this information, we cannot verify if the requirement of the feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance is within the 10% tolerance of the 2/pi value.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (G) is provided as 125 V/nC, but the feedback capacitance (Cf) is not explicitly given. Without Cf, we cannot verify if the expression G x 1.61p / Cf is roughly around 1 within the 10% tolerance.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is specified to be around 40 pC, which does not match the requirement of 161 pC. This is a significant deviation from the specified requirement.

4. The bias current is not explicitly provided, nor is there a mention of how it is generated or regulated.

5. Since the feedback resistance (Rf) is not given, we cannot verify if 0.01 / Rf equals the bias current, as required.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which aligns with the requirement.

7. The project includes optimizations and calculations for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, satisfying this requirement.

8. The output voltage is specified to be 5 V peak, which is not the required 1 V peak to peak.

9. The design includes the selection of a low offset voltage op-amp to maintain an offset less than 10 mV, which meets the requirement.

Given the missing information and deviations from the specified requirements, the project cannot be categorized as "optimal." The design does not have any fatal flaws, so it is not "incorrect" or "unfeasible," but it is not fully aligned with the requirements, making "acceptable" a generous categorization. It is also not "generic" as it includes specific calculations and component choices. Therefore, the project is between "acceptable" and "incorrect," but leans more towards "incorrect" due to the significant deviation in charge output and missing critical information.
