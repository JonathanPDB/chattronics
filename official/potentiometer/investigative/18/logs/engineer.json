    "response": "```Details\nSignal Conditioning Circuit\n\nGiven the information, the signal conditioning block for the potentiometer-based pendulum angle measurement must convert the potentiometer's resistance change into a voltage signal within the +/- 7V range for the DAQ. The topology will primarily consist of a voltage divider and an operational amplifier (op-amp) configuration.\n\nTopology Suggestions:\n1. Voltage Divider: A simple voltage divider will convert the potentiometer's angular position to a voltage. The output of the voltage divider will have a varying voltage dependent on the angle of the pendulum.\n2. Op-Amp Buffer: An op-amp in a buffer (voltage follower) configuration will provide high input impedance to not load the potentiometer and low output impedance to drive the DAQ without signal distortion.\n3. Op-Amp Scaling Amplifier: If needed, an op-amp scaling amplifier can be used to adjust the voltage divider's output to fit within the DAQ's input range of +/- 7V.\n\nParameter Values:\n- Voltage Divider: Considering the pendulum's range of 45 to 135 degrees, which corresponds to 50% of the potentiometer's full range, we can use a fixed resistor in series with the potentiometer to form a voltage divider.\n    - R_fixed = R_potentiometer = 10 kOhms (for equal division at 90 degrees, which is the midpoint of the angular range).\n\n- Op-Amp Buffer/Scaling Amplifier: Assuming a single supply for simplicity and considering no specific voltage levels provided, we can assume a standard operational voltage supply like 12V or 15V for the op-amps. The op-amp should have rail-to-rail capabilities if the supply voltage is close to the maximum DAQ input voltage.\n\nThe final output voltage V_out should swing from -7V to +7V linearly as the pendulum moves from 45 to 135 degrees. The potentiometer, together with R_fixed, will output a voltage that varies from a minimum (V_min) to a maximum (V_max). \n\nWe can calculate the scaling factor (A) for the op-amp as follows:\nA = (DAQ_V_max - DAQ_V_min) / (V_max - V_min)\nA = (7V - (-7V)) / (V_max - V_min)  [Assuming the DAQ range from -7V to +7V]\n\nV_min and V_max can be derived from the voltage divider equation:\nV_min = (V_supply * R_fixed) / (R_fixed + R_potentiometer_min)\nV_max = (V_supply * R_fixed) / (R_fixed + R_potentiometer_max)\n\nAssuming V_supply is the midpoint of the potentiometer's range, we get:\nV_min = V_max = V_supply / 2  [Because R_fixed = R_potentiometer]\n\nTherefore, no scaling (A = 1) is needed if V_supply is chosen properly. An op-amp buffer is sufficient in this case to match the impedance and provide necessary protection/isolation for the DAQ.\n\nHowever, if the actual V_min and V_max do not match the desired range for the DAQ, then an op-amp scaling amplifier with appropriate gain must be used:\n- Non-inverting Amplifier Gain: A = 1 + (R2 / R1)\n    Choose R1 and R2 to set the gain A to the calculated value.\n    For example, if A = 2, then R2 could be 10 kOhms and R1 could be 10 kOhms.\n\nNote: Calibration may be needed to adjust for the exact range and nonlinearity, and this can be achieved through adjustable resistors (potentiometers) in the signal conditioning circuit.\n```",

This topology provides high input impedance, low output impedance, and does not alter the amplitude of the signal, which is desirable for buffering purposes.\n\nOperational Amplifier Selection:\n- Choose an op-amp with rail-to-rail output capability to maximize the dynamic range, ensuring the output can swing to +/- 7 V as required.\n- Since specific bandwidth and slew rate requirements are not provided, select an op-amp with a bandwidth exceeding the highest frequency expected from the pendulum's motion and a slew rate capable of supporting the fastest expected voltage change.\n- Ensure low THD and high SNR characteristics for better signal integrity. Typical audio-grade op-amps have good performance in these areas.\n\nPower Supply:\n- A bipolar power supply is needed to achieve the +/- 7 V output range. If the power supply voltage is unknown, a typical +/- 15 V supply is assumed, which is a common value for operational amplifiers and gives enough headroom for the desired output range.\n\nGain:\n- The gain should be set to unity (Gain = 1) since we only want to buffer the signal without amplification. This can be achieved by directly connecting the op-amp output to its inverting input and driving the signal through the non-inverting input.\n\nResistors:\n- No resistors are needed for gain setting in a voltage follower configuration. However, a feedback resistor (e.g., 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ) might be used to improve stability if the op-amp recommends it.\n\nCapacitors:\n- A small-value capacitor (e.g., 100 pF to 1 nF) may be placed across the feedback path for additional stability if high-frequency oscillations are a concern.\n\nGiven the lack of specific environmental and physical requirements, standard commercial-grade components with general-purpose specifications should suffice. If later detailed requirements regarding temperature, physical size, or other environmental factors are provided, the selection of specific op-amps and additional circuit protection or compensation measures can be revised accordingly.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nANTI_ALIASING_FILTER\n\nGiven the sampling rate of the DAQ system at 1000 samples per second, the Nyquist frequency is 500 Hz. Therefore, the anti-aliasing filter should have a cutoff frequency somewhat lower than 500 Hz to effectively attenuate frequencies that could cause aliasing. A reasonable choice for the cutoff frequency might be around 200 to 250 Hz, ensuring a buffer zone below the Nyquist limit.\n\nIn the absence of specific requirements, a Butterworth filter topology is a good starting point due to its maximally flat response in the passband, which avoids ripples and maintains a consistent gain across the frequency range of interest. \n\nFor attenuation requirements not being specified, a standard 40 dB/decade (2nd order) or 60 dB/decade (3rd order) roll-off is often sufficient to prevent aliasing. A higher order filter provides steeper attenuation at the cost of increased complexity and component count.\n\nSuggested Topology: \nOption 1: 2nd Order Passive or Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency (fc): 250 Hz\n- Roll-off rate: -12 dB/octave or -40 dB/decade\n- Components: Resistors and Capacitors for a passive implementation or an additional Operational Amplifier for an active filter\n\nOption 2: 3rd Order Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency (fc): 200 Hz\n- Roll-off rate: -18 dB/octave or -60 dB/decade\n- Components: Resistors, Capacitors, and an Operational Amplifier\n\nIf phase linearity or transient response is critical, a Bessel filter may be used instead, but for most applications involving pendulum angle measurements, a Butterworth response is adequate. In the event that a sharper cutoff is needed due to noise or other signals near the Nyquist frequency, a higher order filter or a Chebyshev filter with a small amount of passband ripple could be considered.\n\nPhysical size and complexity are not specified, but given the low frequencies involved, the size of the passive components for both 2nd and 3rd order filters would generally be manageable. If an active filter is used, a standard dual or quad op-amp IC could accommodate the necessary filter architecture without significant space requirements.\n\nDamping values are typically defined by the chosen topology and order to maintain the Butterworth characteristic. Specific component values would be calculated based on the desired cutoff frequency and the characteristic impedance of the filter, which is often set to match the impedance of the system or chosen for desired filter performance.\n```",

The DAQ is rated for 1000 samples per second, which defines the minimum sampling rate.\n\nFor potentiometer-based angle measurement, we will consider the typical resolution and suggest an ADC topology. As specific resolution requirements are not provided, a standard 12-bit ADC would give us 4096 distinct values over the 14 V range (+/- 7 V), providing a voltage resolution of approximately 3.4 mV per bit. This should be adequate for most applications unless a higher resolution is specifically required.\n\nThe type of ADC can be chosen based on a balance between cost, performance, and complexity. Given no specific type is required, a Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC would be a good choice due to its balance between speed, power efficiency, and resolution. It is suitable for medium to high resolutions and sample rates, and perfect for 1000 samples/sec.\n\nSince there are no details about the input impedance of the ADC or the communication protocol, we will assume standard values. A high input impedance (\u003e10 kΩ) for the ADC is generally a safe choice to avoid loading effects. Communication protocols such as SPI or I2C are common for SAR ADCs; however, without specifics, a parallel interface could be assumed for simplicity, though SPI is more common and requires fewer connections.\n\nIn conclusion, a 12-bit SAR ADC with at least a 1000 samples/sec sampling rate, a parallel or SPI interface, and a high input impedance would be a suitable choice for this application.\n\nParameters:\n- Resolution: 12-bit (provides ~3.4 mV per bit resolution)\n- Sampling Rate: ≥1000 samples/sec (matches the DAQ system)\n- Input Voltage Range: +/- 7 V (after signal conditioning)\n- ADC Topology: SAR (good balance between cost, speed, and power)\n- Input Impedance: \u003e10 kΩ (to prevent loading effects)\n- Communication Interface: Parallel or SPI (typical for SAR ADCs)\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nPOSITION SENSOR (POTENTIOMETER)\n\nFor this project, since we require a linear potentiometer to calculate the angle of a pendulum within a 90-degree range, we can consider using a precision linear motion potentiometer. These potentiometers are designed to translate mechanical motion into a varying electrical signal and are typically used in applications requiring accurate position sensing.\n\nGiven the requirements and the absence of specific constraints, a suggested model could be the Spectra Symbol SoftPot Membrane Potentiometer. This potentiometer is a good fit as it is thin and flexible, which may be ideal for mounting on a wooden structure. Moreover, it can be sourced in a variety of lengths to match the expected range of motion, and can be trimmed or positioned as needed for the application.\n\nKey considerations for the sensor:\n- Operating Voltage: The potentiometer should be able to operate within the specified voltage range of -10V to 10V. A SoftPot can typically handle a maximum voltage of 10V, which is suitable for this project.\n- Resistance Range: Choose a potentiometer with a resistance high enough to minimize current draw but low enough to provide a strong signal. A value of 10kΩ is a common choice in many applications.\n- Linearity: To ensure that the output voltage is directly proportional to the angle of the pendulum, a potentiometer with good linearity (typically within ±0.5%) is preferred.\n- Resolution: The resolution of a potentiometer is effectively infinite, as it is an analog device. However, the actual resolution in this application will depend on the ADC resolution of the DAQ system.\n- Temperature Range: Standard SoftPots can operate in a temperature range from -35°C to +80°C. Make sure this range is suitable for your application or specify if a high-temperature potentiometer is needed.\n- Size and Mounting: SoftPots can be mounted with an adhesive backing and can conform to some curved surfaces, giving flexibility in design.\n\nSince the project does not specify the need for highly accurate or high-resolution measurements, the chosen potentiometer should be adequate. If the actual conditions of use are more demanding or specific, then those conditions would need to be factored into the selection of the potentiometer.\n```",

The topology will primarily consist of a voltage divider and an operational amplifier (op-amp) configuration.\n\nTopology Suggestions:\n1. Voltage Divider: A simple voltage divider will convert the potentiometer's angular position to a voltage. The output of the voltage divider will have a varying voltage dependent on the angle of the pendulum.\n2. Op-Amp Buffer: An op-amp in a buffer (voltage follower) configuration will provide high input impedance to not load the potentiometer and low output impedance to drive the DAQ without signal distortion.\n3. Op-Amp Scaling Amplifier: If needed, an op-amp scaling amplifier can be used to adjust the voltage divider's output to fit within the DAQ's input range of +/- 7V.\n\nParameter Values:\n- Voltage Divider: Considering the pendulum's range of 45 to 135 degrees, which corresponds to 50% of the potentiometer's full range, we can use a fixed resistor in series with the potentiometer to form a voltage divider.\n    - R_fixed = R_potentiometer = 10 kOhms (for equal division at 90 degrees, which is the midpoint of the angular range).\n\n- Op-Amp Buffer/Scaling Amplifier: Assuming a single supply for simplicity and considering no specific voltage levels provided, we can assume a standard operational voltage supply like 12V or 15V for the op-amps. The op-amp should have rail-to-rail capabilities if the supply voltage is close to the maximum DAQ input voltage.\n\nThe final output voltage V_out should swing from -7V to +7V linearly as the pendulum moves from 45 to 135 degrees. The potentiometer, together with R_fixed, will output a voltage that varies from a minimum (V_min) to a maximum (V_max). \n\nWe can calculate the scaling factor (A) for the op-amp as follows:\nA = (DAQ_V_max - DAQ_V_min) / (V_max - V_min)\nA = (7V - (-7V)) / (V_max - V_min)  [Assuming the DAQ range from -7V to +7V]\n\nV_min and V_max can be derived from the voltage divider equation:\nV_min = (V_supply * R_fixed) / (R_fixed + R_potentiometer_min)\nV_max = (V_supply * R_fixed) / (R_fixed + R_potentiometer_max)\n\nAssuming V_supply is the midpoint of the potentiometer's range, we get:\nV_min = V_max = V_supply / 2  [Because R_fixed = R_potentiometer]\n\nTherefore, no scaling (A = 1) is needed if V_supply is chosen properly. An op-amp buffer is sufficient in this case to match the impedance and provide necessary protection/isolation for the DAQ.\n\nHowever, if the actual V_min and V_max do not match the desired range for the DAQ, then an op-amp scaling amplifier with appropriate gain must be used:\n- Non-inverting Amplifier Gain: A = 1 + (R2 / R1)\n    Choose R1 and R2 to set the gain A to the calculated value.\n    For example, if A = 2, then R2 could be 10 kOhms and R1 could be 10 kOhms.\n\nNote: Calibration may be needed to adjust for the exact range and nonlinearity, and this can be achieved through adjustable resistors (potentiometers) in the signal conditioning circuit.\n```",

This topology provides high input impedance, low output impedance, and does not alter the amplitude of the signal, which is desirable for buffering purposes.\n\nOperational Amplifier Selection:\n- Choose an op-amp with rail-to-rail output capability to maximize the dynamic range, ensuring the output can swing to +/- 7 V as required.\n- Since specific bandwidth and slew rate requirements are not provided, select an op-amp with a bandwidth exceeding the highest frequency expected from the pendulum's motion and a slew rate capable of supporting the fastest expected voltage change.\n- Ensure low THD and high SNR characteristics for better signal integrity. Typical audio-grade op-amps have good performance in these areas.\n\nPower Supply:\n- A bipolar power supply is needed to achieve the +/- 7 V output range. If the power supply voltage is unknown, a typical +/- 15 V supply is assumed, which is a common value for operational amplifiers and gives enough headroom for the desired output range.\n\nGain:\n- The gain should be set to unity (Gain = 1) since we only want to buffer the signal without amplification. This can be achieved by directly connecting the op-amp output to its inverting input and driving the signal through the non-inverting input.\n\nResistors:\n- No resistors are needed for gain setting in a voltage follower configuration. However, a feedback resistor (e.g., 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ) might be used to improve stability if the op-amp recommends it.\n\nCapacitors:\n- A small-value capacitor (e.g., 100 pF to 1 nF) may be placed across the feedback path for additional stability if high-frequency oscillations are a concern.\n\nGiven the lack of specific environmental and physical requirements, standard commercial-grade components with general-purpose specifications should suffice. If later detailed requirements regarding temperature, physical size, or other environmental factors are provided, the selection of specific op-amps and additional circuit protection or compensation measures can be revised accordingly.\n```",

Therefore, the anti-aliasing filter should have a cutoff frequency somewhat lower than 500 Hz to effectively attenuate frequencies that could cause aliasing. A reasonable choice for the cutoff frequency might be around 200 to 250 Hz, ensuring a buffer zone below the Nyquist limit.\n\nIn the absence of specific requirements, a Butterworth filter topology is a good starting point due to its maximally flat response in the passband, which avoids ripples and maintains a consistent gain across the frequency range of interest. \n\nFor attenuation requirements not being specified, a standard 40 dB/decade (2nd order) or 60 dB/decade (3rd order) roll-off is often sufficient to prevent aliasing. A higher order filter provides steeper attenuation at the cost of increased complexity and component count.\n\nSuggested Topology: \nOption 1: 2nd Order Passive or Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency (fc): 250 Hz\n- Roll-off rate: -12 dB/octave or -40 dB/decade\n- Components: Resistors and Capacitors for a passive implementation or an additional Operational Amplifier for an active filter\n\nOption 2: 3rd Order Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency (fc): 200 Hz\n- Roll-off rate: -18 dB/octave or -60 dB/decade\n- Components: Resistors, Capacitors, and an Operational Amplifier\n\nIf phase linearity or transient response is critical, a Bessel filter may be used instead, but for most applications involving pendulum angle measurements, a Butterworth response is adequate. In the event that a sharper cutoff is needed due to noise or other signals near the Nyquist frequency, a higher order filter or a Chebyshev filter with a small amount of passband ripple could be considered.\n\nPhysical size and complexity are not specified, but given the low frequencies involved, the size of the passive components for both 2nd and 3rd order filters would generally be manageable. If an active filter is used, a standard dual or quad op-amp IC could accommodate the necessary filter architecture without significant space requirements.\n\nDamping values are typically defined by the chosen topology and order to maintain the Butterworth characteristic. Specific component values would be calculated based on the desired cutoff frequency and the characteristic impedance of the filter, which is often set to match the impedance of the system or chosen for desired filter performance.\n```",

The DAQ is rated for 1000 samples per second, which defines the minimum sampling rate.\n\nFor potentiometer-based angle measurement, we will consider the typical resolution and suggest an ADC topology. As specific resolution requirements are not provided, a standard 12-bit ADC would give us 4096 distinct values over the 14 V range (+/- 7 V), providing a voltage resolution of approximately 3.4 mV per bit. This should be adequate for most applications unless a higher resolution is specifically required.\n\nThe type of ADC can be chosen based on a balance between cost, performance, and complexity. Given no specific type is required, a Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC would be a good choice due to its balance between speed, power efficiency, and resolution. It is suitable for medium to high resolutions and sample rates, and perfect for 1000 samples/sec.\n\nSince there are no details about the input impedance of the ADC or the communication protocol, we will assume standard values. A high input impedance (\u003e10 kΩ) for the ADC is generally a safe choice to avoid loading effects. Communication protocols such as SPI or I2C are common for SAR ADCs; however, without specifics, a parallel interface could be assumed for simplicity, though SPI is more common and requires fewer connections.\n\nIn conclusion, a 12-bit SAR ADC with at least a 1000 samples/sec sampling rate, a parallel or SPI interface, and a high input impedance would be a suitable choice for this application.\n\nParameters:\n- Resolution: 12-bit (provides ~3.4 mV per bit resolution)\n- Sampling Rate: ≥1000 samples/sec (matches the DAQ system)\n- Input Voltage Range: +/- 7 V (after signal conditioning)\n- ADC Topology: SAR (good balance between cost, speed, and power)\n- Input Impedance: \u003e10 kΩ (to prevent loading effects)\n- Communication Interface: Parallel or SPI (typical for SAR ADCs)\n```",

These potentiometers are designed to translate mechanical motion into a varying electrical signal and are typically used in applications requiring accurate position sensing.\n\nGiven the requirements and the absence of specific constraints, a suggested model could be the Spectra Symbol SoftPot Membrane Potentiometer. This potentiometer is a good fit as it is thin and flexible, which may be ideal for mounting on a wooden structure. Moreover, it can be sourced in a variety of lengths to match the expected range of motion, and can be trimmed or positioned as needed for the application.\n\nKey considerations for the sensor:\n- Operating Voltage: The potentiometer should be able to operate within the specified voltage range of -10V to 10V. A SoftPot can typically handle a maximum voltage of 10V, which is suitable for this project.\n- Resistance Range: Choose a potentiometer with a resistance high enough to minimize current draw but low enough to provide a strong signal. A value of 10kΩ is a common choice in many applications.\n- Linearity: To ensure that the output voltage is directly proportional to the angle of the pendulum, a potentiometer with good linearity (typically within ±0.5%) is preferred.\n- Resolution: The resolution of a potentiometer is effectively infinite, as it is an analog device. However, the actual resolution in this application will depend on the ADC resolution of the DAQ system.\n- Temperature Range: Standard SoftPots can operate in a temperature range from -35°C to +80°C. Make sure this range is suitable for your application or specify if a high-temperature potentiometer is needed.\n- Size and Mounting: SoftPots can be mounted with an adhesive backing and can conform to some curved surfaces, giving flexibility in design.\n\nSince the project does not specify the need for highly accurate or high-resolution measurements, the chosen potentiometer should be adequate. If the actual conditions of use are more demanding or specific, then those conditions would need to be factored into the selection of the potentiometer.\n```",

This provides a voltage output proportional to the angle of the pendulum.\n\nSignal Conditioning Circuit: This block conditions the signal from the potentiometer to fit the input range of the DAQ system.

It may include circuits like a voltage divider or an amplifier to achieve proper scaling.\n\nBuffer Amplifier: A buffer amplifier is used to prevent loading effects on the potentiometer and to maintain signal integrity. It provides a low output impedance which ensures that the signal is not affected by the input impedance of subsequent stages or loads.\n\nAnti-Aliasing Filter: Before the signal is digitized by the ADC, an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove high-frequency components that could cause aliasing errors. This filter is typically a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency just below half the sampling rate of the ADC (Nyquist frequency).\n\nAnalog-to-Digital Converter (DAQ's ADC): The ADC is part of the DAQ system and converts the conditioned analog voltage signal into a digital representation that can be processed or recorded. The choice of ADC resolution is based on the required precision of the angle measurement, but this detail is not specified in the project constraints.\n```"

The topology will primarily consist of a voltage divider and an operational amplifier (op-amp) configuration.\n\nTopology Suggestions:\n1. Voltage Divider: A simple voltage divider will convert the potentiometer's angular position to a voltage. The output of the voltage divider will have a varying voltage dependent on the angle of the pendulum.\n2. Op-Amp Buffer: An op-amp in a buffer (voltage follower) configuration will provide high input impedance to not load the potentiometer and low output impedance to drive the DAQ without signal distortion.\n3. Op-Amp Scaling Amplifier: If needed, an op-amp scaling amplifier can be used to adjust the voltage divider's output to fit within the DAQ's input range of +/- 7V.\n\nParameter Values:\n- Voltage Divider: Considering the pendulum's range of 45 to 135 degrees, which corresponds to 50% of the potentiometer's full range, we can use a fixed resistor in series with the potentiometer to form a voltage divider.\n    - R_fixed = R_potentiometer = 10 kOhms (for equal division at 90 degrees, which is the midpoint of the angular range).\n\n- Op-Amp Buffer/Scaling Amplifier: Assuming a single supply for simplicity and considering no specific voltage levels provided, we can assume a standard operational voltage supply like 12V or 15V for the op-amps. The op-amp should have rail-to-rail capabilities if the supply voltage is close to the maximum DAQ input voltage.\n\nThe final output voltage V_out should swing from -7V to +7V linearly as the pendulum moves from 45 to 135 degrees. The potentiometer, together with R_fixed, will output a voltage that varies from a minimum (V_min) to a maximum (V_max). \n\nWe can calculate the scaling factor (A) for the op-amp as follows:\nA = (DAQ_V_max - DAQ_V_min) / (V_max - V_min)\nA = (7V - (-7V)) / (V_max - V_min)  [Assuming the DAQ range from -7V to +7V]\n\nV_min and V_max can be derived from the voltage divider equation:\nV_min = (V_supply * R_fixed) / (R_fixed + R_potentiometer_min)\nV_max = (V_supply * R_fixed) / (R_fixed + R_potentiometer_max)\n\nAssuming V_supply is the midpoint of the potentiometer's range, we get:\nV_min = V_max = V_supply / 2  [Because R_fixed = R_potentiometer]\n\nTherefore, no scaling (A = 1) is needed if V_supply is chosen properly. An op-amp buffer is sufficient in this case to match the impedance and provide necessary protection/isolation for the DAQ.\n\nHowever, if the actual V_min and V_max do not match the desired range for the DAQ, then an op-amp scaling amplifier with appropriate gain must be used:\n- Non-inverting Amplifier Gain: A = 1 + (R2 / R1)\n    Choose R1 and R2 to set the gain A to the calculated value.\n    For example, if A = 2, then R2 could be 10 kOhms and R1 could be 10 kOhms.\n\nNote: Calibration may be needed to adjust for the exact range and nonlinearity, and this can be achieved through adjustable resistors (potentiometers) in the signal conditioning circuit.\n```"

This topology provides high input impedance, low output impedance, and does not alter the amplitude of the signal, which is desirable for buffering purposes.\n\nOperational Amplifier Selection:\n- Choose an op-amp with rail-to-rail output capability to maximize the dynamic range, ensuring the output can swing to +/- 7 V as required.\n- Since specific bandwidth and slew rate requirements are not provided, select an op-amp with a bandwidth exceeding the highest frequency expected from the pendulum's motion and a slew rate capable of supporting the fastest expected voltage change.\n- Ensure low THD and high SNR characteristics for better signal integrity. Typical audio-grade op-amps have good performance in these areas.\n\nPower Supply:\n- A bipolar power supply is needed to achieve the +/- 7 V output range. If the power supply voltage is unknown, a typical +/- 15 V supply is assumed, which is a common value for operational amplifiers and gives enough headroom for the desired output range.\n\nGain:\n- The gain should be set to unity (Gain = 1) since we only want to buffer the signal without amplification. This can be achieved by directly connecting the op-amp output to its inverting input and driving the signal through the non-inverting input.\n\nResistors:\n- No resistors are needed for gain setting in a voltage follower configuration. However, a feedback resistor (e.g., 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ) might be used to improve stability if the op-amp recommends it.\n\nCapacitors:\n- A small-value capacitor (e.g., 100 pF to 1 nF) may be placed across the feedback path for additional stability if high-frequency oscillations are a concern.\n\nGiven the lack of specific environmental and physical requirements, standard commercial-grade components with general-purpose specifications should suffice. If later detailed requirements regarding temperature, physical size, or other environmental factors are provided, the selection of specific op-amps and additional circuit protection or compensation measures can be revised accordingly.\n```"

Therefore, the anti-aliasing filter should have a cutoff frequency somewhat lower than 500 Hz to effectively attenuate frequencies that could cause aliasing. A reasonable choice for the cutoff frequency might be around 200 to 250 Hz, ensuring a buffer zone below the Nyquist limit.\n\nIn the absence of specific requirements, a Butterworth filter topology is a good starting point due to its maximally flat response in the passband, which avoids ripples and maintains a consistent gain across the frequency range of interest. \n\nFor attenuation requirements not being specified, a standard 40 dB/decade (2nd order) or 60 dB/decade (3rd order) roll-off is often sufficient to prevent aliasing. A higher order filter provides steeper attenuation at the cost of increased complexity and component count.\n\nSuggested Topology: \nOption 1: 2nd Order Passive or Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency (fc): 250 Hz\n- Roll-off rate: -12 dB/octave or -40 dB/decade\n- Components: Resistors and Capacitors for a passive implementation or an additional Operational Amplifier for an active filter\n\nOption 2: 3rd Order Active Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency (fc): 200 Hz\n- Roll-off rate: -18 dB/octave or -60 dB/decade\n- Components: Resistors, Capacitors, and an Operational Amplifier\n\nIf phase linearity or transient response is critical, a Bessel filter may be used instead, but for most applications involving pendulum angle measurements, a Butterworth response is adequate. In the event that a sharper cutoff is needed due to noise or other signals near the Nyquist frequency, a higher order filter or a Chebyshev filter with a small amount of passband ripple could be considered.\n\nPhysical size and complexity are not specified, but given the low frequencies involved, the size of the passive components for both 2nd and 3rd order filters would generally be manageable. If an active filter is used, a standard dual or quad op-amp IC could accommodate the necessary filter architecture without significant space requirements.\n\nDamping values are typically defined by the chosen topology and order to maintain the Butterworth characteristic. Specific component values would be calculated based on the desired cutoff frequency and the characteristic impedance of the filter, which is often set to match the impedance of the system or chosen for desired filter performance.\n```"

The DAQ is rated for 1000 samples per second, which defines the minimum sampling rate.\n\nFor potentiometer-based angle measurement, we will consider the typical resolution and suggest an ADC topology. As specific resolution requirements are not provided, a standard 12-bit ADC would give us 4096 distinct values over the 14 V range (+/- 7 V), providing a voltage resolution of approximately 3.4 mV per bit. This should be adequate for most applications unless a higher resolution is specifically required.\n\nThe type of ADC can be chosen based on a balance between cost, performance, and complexity. Given no specific type is required, a Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC would be a good choice due to its balance between speed, power efficiency, and resolution. It is suitable for medium to high resolutions and sample rates, and perfect for 1000 samples/sec.\n\nSince there are no details about the input impedance of the ADC or the communication protocol, we will assume standard values. A high input impedance (\u003e10 kΩ) for the ADC is generally a safe choice to avoid loading effects. Communication protocols such as SPI or I2C are common for SAR ADCs; however, without specifics, a parallel interface could be assumed for simplicity, though SPI is more common and requires fewer connections.\n\nIn conclusion, a 12-bit SAR ADC with at least a 1000 samples/sec sampling rate, a parallel or SPI interface, and a high input impedance would be a suitable choice for this application.\n\nParameters:\n- Resolution: 12-bit (provides ~3.4 mV per bit resolution)\n- Sampling Rate: ≥1000 samples/sec (matches the DAQ system)\n- Input Voltage Range: +/- 7 V (after signal conditioning)\n- ADC Topology: SAR (good balance between cost, speed, and power)\n- Input Impedance: \u003e10 kΩ (to prevent loading effects)\n- Communication Interface: Parallel or SPI (typical for SAR ADCs)\n```"

These potentiometers are designed to translate mechanical motion into a varying electrical signal and are typically used in applications requiring accurate position sensing.\n\nGiven the requirements and the absence of specific constraints, a suggested model could be the Spectra Symbol SoftPot Membrane Potentiometer. This potentiometer is a good fit as it is thin and flexible, which may be ideal for mounting on a wooden structure. Moreover, it can be sourced in a variety of lengths to match the expected range of motion, and can be trimmed or positioned as needed for the application.\n\nKey considerations for the sensor:\n- Operating Voltage: The potentiometer should be able to operate within the specified voltage range of -10V to 10V. A SoftPot can typically handle a maximum voltage of 10V, which is suitable for this project.\n- Resistance Range: Choose a potentiometer with a resistance high enough to minimize current draw but low enough to provide a strong signal. A value of 10kΩ is a common choice in many applications.\n- Linearity: To ensure that the output voltage is directly proportional to the angle of the pendulum, a potentiometer with good linearity (typically within ±0.5%) is preferred.\n- Resolution: The resolution of a potentiometer is effectively infinite, as it is an analog device. However, the actual resolution in this application will depend on the ADC resolution of the DAQ system.\n- Temperature Range: Standard SoftPots can operate in a temperature range from -35°C to +80°C. Make sure this range is suitable for your application or specify if a high-temperature potentiometer is needed.\n- Size and Mounting: SoftPots can be mounted with an adhesive backing and can conform to some curved surfaces, giving flexibility in design.\n\nSince the project does not specify the need for highly accurate or high-resolution measurements, the chosen potentiometer should be adequate. If the actual conditions of use are more demanding or specific, then those conditions would need to be factored into the selection of the potentiometer.\n```"
