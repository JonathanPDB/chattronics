Score: 7
Explanations: 
The project summary covers the following requirements:

1. The output is being measured by a multimeter: This is directly stated in the Output Block section.
2. There is an amplification stage with a gain of 10, which is adjustable using a potentiometer. However, the justification for the specific gain value is not provided.
3. The output voltage range is not explicitly mentioned to be between 0 and 20 Volts.
4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50Â°C, as mentioned in the Thermistor Sensor Block and Signal Conditioning Block.
5. Linearization of the NTC is stated, which is necessary for the project.
6. The architecture consists of a sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, and optional filtering, fitting the required structure.
7. The sensor used is an NTC (Vishay NTCLE100E3), which is necessary for the project.
8. The self-heating effect is taken into account by using a high-value fixed resistor to limit the current through the NTC, as mentioned in the Thermistor Sensor Block.

Requirements not explicitly covered:
3. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is not specified to be between 0 and 20 Volts.

The project summary successfully covers 7 out of the 8 requirements.
