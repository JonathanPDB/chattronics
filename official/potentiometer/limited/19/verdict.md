Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary describes a pendulum angle measurement system that includes a linear potentiometer, offset adjustment, amplification, filtering, and data acquisition stages. The requirements are as follows:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider: The summary describes a linear potentiometer used for angle measurement, which implies it is being used as a voltage divider.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V: This is not explicitly mentioned, but the sensitivity calculation suggests a 20V range, which could imply +/- 10V.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, an anti-aliasing filter, and then the DAQ: This requirement is met, as the summary describes a voltage divider (potentiometer), an anti-aliasing filter, and a DAQ.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered in 0, for example, +/- 7V: The summary indicates the DAQ has a maximum input voltage of ±7V, which meets this requirement.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V: This requirement is met, as the summary specifies a maximum DAQ input voltage of ±7V.
6. There is a low pass filter to avoid aliasing: An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency of 450 Hz is described, which meets this requirement.
7. There is a filter removing frequencies between around 50 and 60 Hz: A band-stop filter designed to attenuate 50 Hz and 60 Hz noise is included, meeting this requirement.
8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz: Although a low-pass filter with a cutoff of 450 Hz is mentioned, there is no explicit information about the gain at 500 Hz. However, a second-order low-pass filter should have a roll-off rate of 12 dB per octave, which would provide more than -20 dB of attenuation at 500 Hz given a 450 Hz cutoff.

The summary meets most of the requirements, but it does not explicitly confirm that the potentiometer is powered by a +/- 10V supply. Furthermore, while it is likely that the low-pass filter will meet the -20 dB gain requirement at 500 Hz, this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the summary is marked as 'acceptable' because it can be implemented and does not have any fatal issues, but the information provided is not entirely complete.
