1. Use a piezoelectric accelerometer
2. The accelerometer has a sensitivity of 100 pC/g (g is the acceleration due to gravity)
3. Use the peak to peak acceleration to calculate charge
4. An input oscillation has a frequency up to 2 Hz
5. The input oscillation has a peak amplification of 5 cm.
6. Output voltage should be 1 V peak to peak
7. Low frequency response of the system has to be 3 dB down at 0.25 Hz
8. The offset should be kept as less than 10 mV
