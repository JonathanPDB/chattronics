Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project review for the Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device based on the requirements provided is as follows:

Requirement 1: The feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance (Rf * Cf) should be around 2/pi. With Rf = 100 MΩ and Cf = 470 pF, Rf * Cf = 47 ns which is not close to the required 2/pi ≈ 0.637 ns. This requirement is not met.

Requirement 2: The charge amplifier gain multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (G x 1.61p / Cf) should be around 1. Without the specific gain (G) of the charge amplifier, this requirement cannot be verified. However, with the given values, it's unlikely that the gain would result in the required outcome.

Requirement 3: The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC. The design notes a maximum expected charge (Qmax) of 402.7 pC, which exceeds the specified requirement. This requirement is not met.

Requirement 4: The bias current must be provided. The design does not explicitly mention the bias current for the operational amplifier.

Requirement 5: 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current (0.01 / Rf = Ibias). This requirement cannot be verified without the bias current information.

Requirement 6: The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor. This is met as the design includes a charge amplifier with a feedback resistor and capacitor.

Requirement 7: The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude and has calculations to back it up. This is met as the design includes calculations for maximum expected charge based on a 5 cm peak displacement at 2 Hz.

Requirement 8: The output voltage is 1 V peak to peak. The design aims for 2.3 V peak at the ADC input, which is not consistent with the 1 V peak to peak requirement. This requirement is not met.

Requirement 9: The offset should be kept below 10 mV. The design does not provide explicit information on offset voltage; however, the choice of low input bias current, low offset voltage op-amps suggests that the design may meet this requirement.

Given that several essential requirements are not met, particularly the feedback time constant, charge output, and output voltage, the design does not meet the necessary criteria for an "optimal" or "acceptable" verdict. The lack of specific details regarding bias current and the actual gain of the charge amplifier further complicates the assessment. However, the design is theoretically correct and contains elements that could be implemented with adjustments, making it "unfeasible" rather than "incorrect."
