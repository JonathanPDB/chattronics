Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) product is Rf * Cf = 620 kΩ * 1 nF = 620 * 10^3 * 10^-9 F = 620 * 10^-6 s. The required product is approximately 2/pi = 0.6366197723, with a 10% allowance. The calculated product is within the 10% allowance of the required value (0.6366197723 ± 10%).

2. The gain (G) of the charge amplifier is 10^7 V/C, and the feedback capacitance (Cf) is 1 nF. The equation G * 1.61E-12 / Cf must be roughly around 1. Substituting the values: 10^7 V/C * 1.61E-12 C / 1E-9 F = 16.1, which is not within the 10% allowance of 1.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not provided in the summary, so it is not possible to verify if it is around 161 pC.

4. The bias current is not explicitly provided in the summary.

5. The relationship between the bias current and the feedback resistance is not provided in the summary.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as mentioned in the charge amplifier design section.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, as indicated by the low-pass filter design with a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz, but there is no mention of a 5 cm amplitude or calculations to back this up.

8. The output voltage of the charge amplifier is designed to be 1 V peak to peak, as stated in the charge amplifier design section.

9. The offset voltage is not specified, so it is not possible to verify if it is kept below 10 mV.
