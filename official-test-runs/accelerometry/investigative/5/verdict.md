Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project's design for a low-frequency vibration measurement device incorporates various essential components and considerations. However, there are discrepancies and missing details in relation to the stated requirements:

1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and capacitance (C_f) product is not aligned with the requirement. R_f * C_f should be roughly 2/π (approximately 0.637), but with R_f = 620 kΩ and C_f = 1 nF, the product is 620. This does not meet the requirement of being within 10% of 2/π.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (A_v) is 1 MV/C, but it is unclear how this relates to the requirement of G x 1.61p / C_f being roughly around 1 (within 10%). Without the actual value of G, this requirement cannot be verified.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly stated in relation to the 161 pC requirement, aside from an assumed input charge (Q_max) of 1000 pC, which does not directly correspond to the output.

4. There is no mention of the bias current in the design, which is an essential requirement for evaluating the project.

5. The relationship between 0.01 / R_f and the bias current is not provided, making it impossible to verify if this requirement is met.

6. While the project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, there is no clear indication that the other requirements are optimized for this setup.

7. The optimization for input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude is not backed up with calculations, as required.

8. The output voltage is assumed to be 1 V peak to peak, which aligns with the requirement.

9. There is no mention of the offset voltage, which should be kept below 10 mV.

Given these observations, the project does not fulfill several of the essential requirements, particularly the feedback resistance and capacitance product, the bias current considerations, and the optimization details for the input oscillation. Therefore, the verdict for this project is "unfeasible," as it contains elements that make it impossible to implement as per the given requirements.
