Score: 8
Explanations: 
1. The output is being measured by a multimeter: The summary explicitly states that the output voltage is suitable for measurement by a multimeter.

2. There should be an amplification stage and the gain must be provided and justified: The gain stage is described with an amplification factor of Av = 10 to amplify a presumed 0-2V to 0-20V range, which is justified as necessary to fit the multimeter's measurement range.

3. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is between 0 and 20 Volts: The gain stage is designed to output a voltage range of 0-20V, meeting this requirement.

4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC: The summary mentions using a 7 kΩ parallel resistor for linearization at the midpoint temperature of 50°C, which satisfies this requirement.

5. The NTC is linearized: As stated above, the NTC is linearized with a parallel resistor, fulfilling this requirement.

6. The architecture should be roughly consisting of the sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering and measurement: The summary describes an architecture with all these elements, including a sensor (NTC), linearization network, buffer amplifier, gain stage, and low-pass filter before measurement.

7. The sensor used is an NTC: The project uses a Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor, confirming the use of an NTC sensor.

8. The self-heating effect is taken into account and the maximum current that passes through the NTC is known: The operating current is stated to be in the microampere range to prevent self-heating, indicating that this effect is considered.
