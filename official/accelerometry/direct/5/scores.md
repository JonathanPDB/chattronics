Score: 3
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (R_f) is 68 MÎ© and the feedback capacitance (C_f) is 10 pF. The product R_f x C_f = 68e6 * 10e-12 = 680e-6 s. The desired value is roughly 2/pi = 0.637, allowing up to 10% difference. The actual product is within this range, so this requirement is met.

2. There's no explicit gain (G) given for the charge amplifier, so we cannot directly verify the second requirement. However, since the output voltage is specified to be 1V peak-to-peak and the peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC, we can infer that the gain G might be designed to achieve this output. Without explicit values, however, we cannot confirm this requirement.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output being around 161 pC is not explicitly mentioned, but the accelerometer sensitivity is 100 pC/g, and the output voltage is 1V peak-to-peak. Without information about the acceleration experienced by the accelerometer, we cannot determine if the peak-to-peak charge output is around 161 pC.

4. Bias current is not mentioned in the summary, so we cannot confirm this requirement.

5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current cannot be confirmed since the bias current is not provided.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as mentioned in the summary.

7. There is no information provided about the project being optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, nor are there calculations to back this up.

8. The output voltage is specified to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets this requirement.

9. The offset is mentioned to be minimal, but there is no specific value given to confirm that it is kept below 10 mV.

The project summary successfully covers requirements 1, 6, and 8.
