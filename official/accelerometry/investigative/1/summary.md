Design of a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

SENSOR SELECTION:
- A piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g is required to measure low-frequency vibrations up to 2 Hz with a peak amplitude of 5 cm.
- Suggested Model: PCB Piezotronics 352C33 or similar, with appropriate sensitivity and frequency response.

CHARGE AMPLIFIER DESIGN:
- The charge amplifier converts the charge signal from the accelerometer to a voltage.
- Based on accelerometer sensitivity and desired output, the gain of the charge amplifier is calculated to be 12.5 V/nC.
- To achieve a desired output voltage of 1 V peak-to-peak, a feedback capacitor (C_f) of 127 nF and feedback resistor (R_f) of 10 MΩ are recommended.
- A low bias current, low noise precision op-amp such as the AD8628 or OPA129 is suggested for the charge amplifier design.

LOW-PASS FILTER DESIGN:
- A 3 dB cutoff frequency at 0.25 Hz is specified for the low-pass filter.
- Two filter topology suggestions:
  1. Passive RC Filter: First-order with R = 10 kΩ and C ≈ 63.66 μF (adjusted to the nearest standard value, e.g., 68 μF).
  2. Active Butterworth Filter: Second-order Sallen-Key with R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ and C1 = C2 ≈ 63.66 μF (adjusted to the nearest standard value).

ADC SELECTION:
- A Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC is suggested.
- A resolution of 12 to 16 bits, and a sampling rate of at least 20 Hz is recommended to capture the vibration signal.
- The ADC should have a low-power mode and an SPI interface for communication with the microcontroller/DSP.
- Input range should be compatible with the output of the charge amplifier, at least 0 to 1 V or ±0.5 V for a bipolar input.

MICROCONTROLLER/DSP SELECTION:
- A microcontroller or DSP with adequate processing power for the application's needs, such as an ARM Cortex-M4 or M7 series, is suggested.
- The microcontroller should support multiple communication interfaces and low-power modes.
- For development, a flexible platform like Arduino or Raspberry Pi can be used for prototyping, with the option to transition to a more specialized platform for the final product.

Given the lack of specific information on power supply, communication requirements, and environmental constraints, general industry standards and flexible designs have been suggested to accommodate a variety of potential use cases. The exact component models and values may need to be adjusted based on detailed requirements and testing during the development process.
