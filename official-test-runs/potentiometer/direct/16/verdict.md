Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project description provides a comprehensive plan for designing an analog system to measure the angle of a pendulum using a potentiometer and a DAQ system. Here are the points of consideration based on the requirements provided:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, which aligns with the given requirements.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V, meeting the specification.
3. The architecture includes a buffer amplifier, scaling amplifier, band-stop filter, and an anti-aliasing filter before the DAQ, which is a simple and effective design.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0 V with a range of +/- 7 V, which is within the requirements.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7 V, ensuring that the DAQ's input limits are not exceeded.
6. An anti-aliasing filter with a 2nd order Butterworth low-pass filter having a cutoff frequency of 250 Hz is included to prevent aliasing.
7. A band-stop filter is designed to attenuate frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, thus addressing potential power line interference.
8. However, the anti-aliasing filter specification does not explicitly ensure a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, which was a requirement. A 2nd order Butterworth filter has an attenuation of -12 dB per octave beyond the cutoff frequency. Since the cutoff is at 250 Hz, and we need -20 dB at 500 Hz (which is one octave above 250 Hz), the attenuation at 500 Hz would be approximately -15 dB, not meeting the -20 dB requirement.

The project satisfies most requirements, but the anti-aliasing filter does not meet the specified attenuation level at 500 Hz. This may not be a fatal issue, as the anti-aliasing filter can be redesigned to achieve the required attenuation. Therefore, the project can be categorized as "acceptable."
