Comprehensive Analog Instrumentation System Design for Machine Monitoring

Pressure Sensor Array:
- Suggested industrial-grade strain gauge pressure transducers (e.g., Honeywell MLH Series or equivalent)
- Assumed pressure range: 0 to 10 bar
- Assumed temperature range: -40°C to +125°C
- Typical excitation voltage: 5V to 24VDC (10VDC common)
- Current consumption: Typically below 20 mA
- Additional considerations for overpressure tolerance and environmental conditions will be based on application-specific requirements.

Instrumentation Amplifier Array:
- Amplifier gain: Adjustable, with a maximum of around x5000, assuming a 5V ADC input range and a sensor output of 1 mV
- Amplifier type: High CMRR instrumentation amplifier (e.g., AD620, INA118)
- Power supply: Dual supply assumed (±12 V or ±15 V), with the exact value based on system power availability
- Bandwidth: At least 10 kHz to accommodate a signal frequency of 400 Hz without attenuation
- Temperature stability: Selected amplifiers should have good temperature performance or include temperature compensation circuits

Multiplexer1:
- Analog multiplexer IC for 8 channels (e.g., ADG708, ADG732, 74HC4051, CD4051 for single-ended signals; MAX14752, MAX14750 for differential signals)
- Low on-resistance (<100 Ohms) and low charge injection for minimizing transient errors
- Off-leakage current in the picoampere to nanoampere range
- Bandwidth: 1 MHz or higher for minimal signal attenuation at 400 Hz
- ESD protection and level shifting may be required based on system environment and logic levels

ADC1:
- Type: 12-bit SAR ADC recommended for balance between speed and resolution
- Input range: 0 to 100 mV (assumed to be matched by a PGA if necessary)
- Resolution: 12-bit or higher to resolve changes finer than 1 mV per bit
- Sampling rate: At least 1kHz to account for aliasing protection above the 400 Hz signal frequency
- Interface: Serial communication such as SPI or I2C, depending on speed and complexity requirements
- Input buffering and anti-aliasing filters should be implemented accordingly

Temperature Sensor Array:
- Non-contact infrared thermometer IC (e.g., MLX90614 or equivalent) assumed with the following characteristics:
  - Temperature range: -70°C to +380°C
  - Accuracy: ±0.5°C around room temperature
  - Resolution: 0.02°C
  - Sensitivity: Corresponds to the resolution, detecting changes as small as 0.02°C
  - Supply voltage: 3.3V to 5V
  - Output: Digital (PWM or SMBus/I2C)

Amplifier/Filter Array for Temperature Sensors:
- Gain: Factor enough to amplify signals from the sensors to the required ADC input voltage range
- Filter: Low-pass active filter with a cutoff frequency around 500 Hz (1st-order, choosing resistor R = 10 kΩ, capacitor C = 33 nF)

Multiplexer2:
- 8-channel analog multiplexer IC with bandwidth exceeding 400 Hz (e.g., CD74HC4067)
- Each channel includes a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency slightly above 400 Hz
- Protection and isolation features such as TVS diodes and optoisolators may be necessary

ADC2:
- Type: 12-bit SAR ADC to match resolution and sampling rate requirements
- Input range: 0 V to 100 mV (or with a PGA if necessary)
- Sampling rate: At least 10 samples per second per channel
- Interface: SPI or I2C recommended
- Additional considerations for buffering and synchronization if necessary

Data Acquisition System:
- Digital low-pass filters with a cutoff frequency slightly over 400 Hz
- Sampling rate: At least 800 Hz per channel (1 kHz to 2 kHz recommended)
- Software compatibility with platforms such as LabVIEW or MATLAB/Simulink
- Data buffering and format to maintain bit-depth and accuracy
- Environmental considerations for industrial standards

Computer Interface:
- Default communication protocol: USB or Ethernet based on availability and requirements
- Data buffering to manage potential latency
- Throughput: Capable of handling the cumulative data rate of all sensors
- Isolation: Opto-isolators or magnetic isolators for electrical isolation
- Environmental protection: IP54 or higher rated casing and EMC considerations
- Connector quality: High-reliability connectors like USB Type B or Ethernet RJ45
