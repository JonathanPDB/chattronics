Score: 7
Explanations: 
The project summary covers the following requirements:

1. The multimeter usage is mentioned as the instrument for measuring the output voltage, satisfying the first requirement.
2. There is mention of an amplification stage with a gain of 20, which is justified by the need to scale the maximum expected voltage from the linearization network to the full 0-20 Volts range of the multimeter, thereby satisfying the second requirement.
3. The output voltage range of 0 to 20 Volts is clearly stated, meeting the third requirement.
4. The linearization of the NTC thermistor at the midrange of 50°C with a parallel resistor value is mentioned, satisfying the fourth requirement.
5. Linearization is explicitly stated as essential for accurate voltage output, which meets the fifth requirement.
6. The project includes a sensor (NTC thermistor), a linearization stage (parallel resistor for linearization at 50°C), amplification (buffer amplifier and scaling amplifier), and measurement (multimeter), which aligns with the sixth requirement.
7. An NTC thermistor is specified as the sensor, meeting the seventh requirement.
8. The summary does not provide information on the self-heating effect or the maximum current passing through the NTC, so the eighth requirement is not covered.

Overall, the project summary satisfies 7 out of the 8 requirements. The only requirement not explicitly covered is the consideration of the self-heating effect and the knowledge of the maximum current passing through the NTC.
