I want to develop a project that calculates the angle of a pendulum by using a potentiometer.
The component will be fixed to a wooden structure and another beam will be connected to the adjustable pin.
The output must be viewed using LabVIEW and, therefore, will be measured using a DAQ.
Use the simplest design possible, which takes into account all requirements.
