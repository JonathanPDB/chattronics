Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a detailed overview of a low-frequency vibration measurement device, including the design of a charge amplifier, filter stages, gain stage, and digital signal processing. However, several requirements outlined for the project review are not met or not clearly addressed:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) product is not specified to be around 2/pi, nor is any deviation within 10% mentioned. With an Rf of 3.9 MÎ© and Cf of 160 pF, the RfCf product is 0.624 s, which is not close to the required 2/pi (approximately 0.637 s).
2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not explicitly stated, so it is unclear if it meets the requirement of G x 1.61p / Cf being roughly around 1 within a 10% difference.
3. The peak-to-peak charge output is reported to be 160 pC, which is slightly below the required 161 pC, but this difference is within a reasonable margin and is acceptable.
4. The bias current is not provided, which is an essential requirement.
5. The relationship between the bias current and feedback resistance (0.01 / Rf = bias current) is not discussed in the project summary.
6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as required.
7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, and while calculations are mentioned, they are not detailed in the summary.
8. The output voltage is assumed to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets the requirement.
9. The offset voltage is not explicitly stated to be kept below 10 mV, though the use of a low-noise op-amp suggests an attempt to minimize offset.

Based on the information provided, the design does not meet all the essential requirements, particularly the RfCf product, the gain condition relative to Cf, the provision of a bias current, and the relationship between bias current and feedback resistance. The project summary suggests that the design is theoretically correct and could be implemented with some adjustments, but it lacks the specificity to confirm compliance with all the required parameters.
