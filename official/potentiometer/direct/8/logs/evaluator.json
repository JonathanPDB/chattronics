With Ri = 10 kΩ, we get Rf = 6.5 kΩ.\n\nNotch Filter Component Selection:\nFor 50 Hz, we use the formula C = 1 / (2 * π * f * R), with R = 10 kΩ and f = 50 Hz, yielding C ≈ 3.18 nF. Similarly, for 60 Hz, with R = 10 kΩ, we get C ≈ 265 nF.\n\nAnti-aliasing Filter Design:\nWith the cutoff frequency (fc) set just below 500 Hz, we use R = 10 kΩ and calculate C using C = 1 / (2 * π * fc * R), resulting in C ≈ 3.3 μF as the nearest standard value.\n\nWith the information provided and under the assumption of an indoor application without extreme environmental conditions, these selections and calculations form the basis for a robust pendulum angle measurement system suited for general use."

    "response": "```explanations\n1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider: This is implicitly met as the potentiometer converts the pendulum's angular position into a corresponding voltage signal.\n\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V: This is not explicitly stated, but the use of a level shifter and a gain stage suggests that the input voltage range is indeed +/- 10 V.\n\n3. The architecture is simple: The system includes a voltage divider (with a voltage buffer), a level shifter, notch filters, an anti-aliasing filter, a gain stage, and a DAQ. This meets the requirement for a simple architecture.\n\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, for example, +/- 7V: The level shifter and gain stage are designed to ensure that the voltage range is within the DAQ's +/- 7 V input range.\n\n5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V: The design explicitly ensures that the voltage does not exceed +/- 7 V.\n\n6. There is a low pass filter (or anti-aliasing filter) that avoids aliasing: The design includes an anti-aliasing filter with a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter, which satisfies this requirement.\n\n7. There is a filter removing frequencies between around 50 and 60 Hz: The design includes active twin-T notch filters for both 50 Hz and 60 Hz, meeting this requirement.\n\n8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz: The anti-aliasing filter is a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz, which should provide at least -20 dB of attenuation at 500 Hz. However, without the exact cutoff frequency and the order of the filter, it is not possible to confirm this requirement with certainty.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n7\n```",
