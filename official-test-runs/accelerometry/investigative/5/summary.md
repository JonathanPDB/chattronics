Design of a Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

The design of a portable device for measuring low-frequency vibrations encompasses several blocks: the piezoelectric sensor, charge amplifier, low-pass filter, gain stage, output buffer, anti-aliasing filter, and the ADC.

Piezoelectric Sensor:
- Suggested Model: PCB Piezotronics 352C33 or similar with 100 pC/g sensitivity.
- Sensitivity: 100 pC/g, which is suitable for detecting vibrations with a peak amplification of 5 cm.

Charge Amplifier:
- Feedback Capacitor (C_f): 1 nF (standard value, to be fine-tuned based on sensor specifications).
- Feedback Resistor (R_f): 620 kΩ selected based on the desired bandwidth of 0.25 Hz to 2 Hz. Calculated using f_L = 1 / (2 * π * R_f * C_f).
- Assumed Input Charge (Q_max): 1000 pC for a 1 V peak-to-peak output. The gain of the charge amplifier (A_v) is then 1 MV/C.

Low-pass Filter:
- Type: Butterworth filter for a maximally flat passband.
- Order: First order (single pole).
- Cutoff Frequency (f_c): 0.25 Hz, with component values depending on the source impedance.

Gain Stage:
- Gain (G): 100.
- Topology: Non-inverting amplifier with a precision operational amplifier.
- Feedback Network: Rf = 99 * Ri for approximate gain of 100.

Output Buffer:
- Operational Amplifier: Low power consumption op-amp like AD8628 or OPA333, suitable for battery operation.
- Topology: Voltage Follower (Unity Gain Buffer).

Anti-aliasing Filter:
- Filter Type: Second-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 3 Hz.
- Characteristics: Maximally flat passband, suitable for attenuating frequencies beyond the desired range.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
- Topology: Delta-Sigma (ΔΣ) ADC.
- Resolution: At least 16-bit.
- Sampling Rate: At least 10 Hz, to accommodate a margin above the Nyquist rate.
- Interface: SPI or I2C for easy integration with digital systems.

The device will be designed to work with a common single supply voltage close to the desired output voltage, such as 3.3V or 5V, ensuring maximum signal swing for the ADC. The system should use SMD components to minimize size and employ proper bypassing and grounding techniques to reduce noise and improve performance.
