Design a portable device capable of measuring low-frequency vibration.
Use a piezoelectric accelerometer
The accelerometer has a sensitivity of 100 pC/g
An input oscillation has a frequency of 2Hz
The input oscillation has an amplification of 5cm.
Output voltage should be 1 V peak to peak
Low frequency response is 3 dB down at 0.25 Hz
The offset should be kept as less than 10mv
