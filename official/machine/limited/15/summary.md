Design of an Analog Sensor Acquisition System for Pressure and Temperature Monitoring

The architecture of the project is designed to monitor pressure and surface temperature variations at eight points on a machine. The sensor data is conditioned and converted to digital form for computer analysis, ensuring 1% accuracy. Below is the summary of the proposed solution based on the requirements and the assumptions made throughout the conversation.

Pressure Sensor Array (x8):
- Strain-Gauge Pressure Sensor: Industrial-grade, Honeywell S Series SSC, with a measurement range of 0 to 10 bar and accuracy better than 0.01 bar.
- Amplification: Instrumentation amplifier (e.g., AD620) with a gain of approximately 4500 to amplify the 1 mV signal to around 4.5 V to match the ADC's input range.
- Filtering: Low-pass filter with a 400 Hz cutoff frequency using a Sallen-Key configuration with components calculated for a Butterworth response. Assuming 1kΩ source and load impedance, component values are estimated to be C1 = C2 = 1 µF, R1 = R2 ≈ 398 Ω.

Temperature Sensor Array (x8):
- Infrared Radiation Detector: Melexis MLX90614ESF-BAA, with a broad temperature measurement range of -70°C to +380°C and a sensitivity of 0.02°C.
- Non-Linear Conversion Circuit: Assuming a logarithmic/exponential method using precision resistors, matched transistors (e.g., 2N3904), and operational amplifiers (e.g., OPAx340), with temperature compensation using NTC/PTC thermistors.
- Amplification: Non-inverting operational amplifier circuit with a fixed gain of 50. Potential op-amps include LM324 or TL081.

Multiplexer:
- Dual 8:1 Multiplexer/Demultiplexer IC (e.g., CD4052BE), with low on-resistance (<100 Ohms), high off-isolation (>70 dB), and fast switch time (<200 ns), and digital control interface compatible with the microcontroller (SPI or I2C).

Sample and Hold Circuit:
- Analog Switch: High-speed CMOS switch like the ADG419.
- Hold Capacitor: Teflon or polypropylene type, 0.1 µF, low-leakage, and stable.
- Buffer Amplifier: Precision op-amp such as the OPA365.

ADC:
- A 12-bit resolution multiplexed ADC with at least 2 kHz sampling rate per channel and an SPI interface. A model with a 0-5 V input range is assumed. Example: ADS7953 from Texas Instruments.

Data Interface to Computer:
- Interface Type: USB for short distances or Ethernet for high data rates and longer distances. Direct memory access (DMA) recommended for minimal latency.
- Data Formatting: Packets with headers including timestamp, sensor ID, and error-checking code.
- Software Compatibility: Ensure support for operating systems and availability of drivers or SDKs.

Each block was designed to ensure the highest accuracy and reliability within the industrial application context, taking into account the lack of specific user requirements. The chosen components and methods provide a robust foundation for the monitoring system, with the flexibility to make adjustments based on the actual implementation and testing.
