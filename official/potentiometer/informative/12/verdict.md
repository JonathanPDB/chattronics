Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project outline for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System Design includes several components that align with the specified requirements. Here's an analysis of each point:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider and is within the specifications with a resistance of 10 kOhms.

2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the +/-10 V range, but the specification mentions "up to 7 Volts". This is lower than the +/-10 V given in the requirement.

3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, a buffer amplifier (voltage follower), and an anti-aliasing filter, followed by the DAQ measurement. This matches the requirement.

4. The DAQ's input voltage needs to be centered at 0, such as +/-7 V. However, the description does not specify the DAQ input voltage range. This information is critical and needs clarification.

5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is not explicitly stated. The project mentions "up to 7 Volts" for the potentiometer, but it is not clear if this is the same for the DAQ. This is an essential requirement that has not been clearly met.

6. An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency of 250 Hz is included in the design, which should prevent aliasing as required.

7. A low-pass filter with a notch to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz is proposed, meeting the requirement for filtering out this range of noise.

8. The low-pass filter's cutoff frequency is 400 Hz, which is close to the required range, and the filter type is Butterworth for a flat passband. However, the order of the filter and the exact gain at 500 Hz (-20 dB or lower) are not specified. This information is crucial to ensure the requirement is met.

The design is close to meeting the requirements, but critical information is missing or not explicitly stated, particularly regarding the DAQ's input voltage range and the maximum voltage applied to it. Additionally, the exact performance of the filter at 500 Hz is not detailed, and the voltage applied to the potentiometer does not match the +/-10 V requirement. Therefore, the verdict is "unfeasible" since it contains elements that make it impossible to implement as it currently stands.
