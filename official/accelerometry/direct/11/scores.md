Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (R_f) times the feedback capacitance (C_f) should be around 2/pi. Given R_f = 620 kΩ and C_f = 1 nF, the product R_f * C_f = 620 * 10^3 * 1 * 10^-9 = 620 * 10^-6 = 620 μs. The target value is 2/pi μs ≈ 0.637 μs. The given product is significantly larger than the target value, so this requirement is not met.

2. The charge amplifier gain (G) multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (C_f) should be around 1. Given G = 100 MV/C = 100 * 10^6 V/C and C_f = 1 nF = 1 * 10^-9 F, the expression G * 1.61E-12 / C_f = (100 * 10^6 * 1.61E-12) / (1 * 10^-9) = 161 * 10^-3 ≈ 0.161. This value is significantly different from the target value of 1, so this requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly given, but it can be inferred from the gain of the charge amplifier and the specified output voltage. The gain is 100 MV/C which means for each picocoulomb (pC) of charge input, the output voltage increases by 100 mV. For a 1 V peak-to-peak output, the corresponding charge input would be 10 pC peak-to-peak, which is different from the required 161 pC. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

4. The bias current is provided, as specified by the operational amplifier (LMC6001) with an ultra-low bias current of less than 16 pA, which satisfies this requirement.

5. The value of 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (R_f) must equal the bias current. Given R_f = 620 kΩ, 0.01 / R_f = 0.01 / (620 * 10^3) = 16.13 pA, which is in the same order of magnitude as the provided bias current of less than 16 pA. This requirement is implicitly met within an acceptable range.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the signal from a piezoelectric sensor, as required.

7. The charge amplifier is optimized for a 3 dB point at approximately 0.25 Hz, which is suitable for an input oscillation of 2 Hz. However, there are no explicit calculations provided to back up the optimization for an amplitude of 5 cm. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

8. The output voltage is specified to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets this requirement.

9. The bias current specification and the choice of the operational amplifier suggest that the voltage offset is kept below 10 mV, satisfying this requirement.
