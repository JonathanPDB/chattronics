Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project summary describes an analog temperature measurement system intended for reading the temperature of a water beaker using an NTC thermistor. The architecture includes a temperature sensor block, constant current source block, signal conditioning amplifier block, and output scaling amplifier block. It is noted that an anti-aliasing filter and ADC block are not implemented as the output is intended for a multimeter.

The summary meets several requirements:
- The output is measured by a multimeter (Requirement 1).
- There is an amplification stage with a gain of 200, which is justified by the need to scale a 100mV input range to a 0-20V output range (Requirement 2).
- The output voltage range is between 0 and 20 Volts (Requirement 3).
- The NTC thermistor is used as the sensor (Requirement 7).
- The self-heating effect is taken into account with a maximum current of 100 µA passing through the NTC (Requirement 8).

However, there are important details missing or not explicitly addressed in the summary:
- It is not made clear how the NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC (Requirement 4). Linearization is critical, and without explicit mention of how this is achieved, it is uncertain whether Requirement 5 (mandatory linearization) is met.
- The architecture described follows the general structure of sensor, linearization stage, amplification, and measurement, but without detail on the linearization stage, it's uncertain if the architecture is fully compliant (Requirement 6).

Given the information provided, the system seems to be theoretically correct, but with a critical lack of detail regarding the linearization of the NTC thermistor, which is a mandatory requirement. If linearization is not properly implemented, the system would not meet the project requirements. Therefore, the summary falls short of being "optimal" or "acceptable" due to the potential issue with linearization.
