The notch filter will remove the 50 and 60 Hz mains interference, while the low-pass filter will provide a smooth output signal suitable for the DAQ.\n\nTOPOLOGY:\n- A Twin-T Notch Filter for attenuating the 50 and 60 Hz frequencies.\n- A Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter for the overall signal conditioning.\n\nTWIN-T NOTCH FILTER:\n- Target Frequency (f_notch): 50 Hz and 60 Hz (two separate notch filters or a switchable design).\n- Quality Factor (Q): Ideally between 2 to 5 to balance between sharp rejection and stability.\n- Component values will depend on the desired Q and the impedance levels of the circuit. These components include resistors and capacitors that resonate at the target frequencies.\n\nSALLEN-KEY LOW-PASS FILTER:\n- Cut-off Frequency (f_c): Assuming the pendulum's maximum oscillation frequency is much lower than 50 Hz, a cut-off frequency of around 10 Hz would likely suffice.\n- Filter Order: Second order (provides a -12 dB/octave or -40 dB/decade roll-off).\n- Type: Butterworth for maximized flat response in passband.\n- Damping Factor (ζ): 0.707 for a maximally flat passband (no ripple).\n\nCOMPONENT SELECTION:\n- Resistors and Capacitors: To be calculated based on the desired Q for the notch filter and the cut-off frequency for the low-pass filter. The values will also need to take into account the driving capability of the buffer and the input impedance of the DAQ.\n- Operational Amplifiers (for an active Sallen-Key design): Low-noise op-amps with sufficient bandwidth to accommodate the low-pass filter frequency range and the DAQ input impedance.\n\nIt is important to note that the values for the components of each filter will need to be refined based on the specific parameters of the system once they are known. These include the maximum pendulum oscillation frequency, the desired signal preservation requirements, and the impedance characteristics of the overall circuit. Without these specifics, the provided suggestions are based on typical values that would ensure a clean signal for a typical low-frequency measurement system while eliminating common noise sources such as mains interference.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nADC_BLOCK\n\nGiven the lack of specific requirements for the ADC, we must make general assumptions based on the context to suggest an ADC implementation. Here are the suggestions based on typical requirements for the described application:\n\n- **Resolution**: Assuming that the pendulum angle measurements do not need to be extremely precise, a 12-bit ADC would typically provide sufficient resolution for most control and monitoring applications. This will provide a resolution of 4096 levels across the voltage range. If the pendulum's angle range is from 45 to 135 degrees, this equates to approximately 0.022 degrees per level, which is generally adequate for such measurements.\n\n- **Sampling Rate**: For a pendulum application, where the motion is relatively slow compared to electronic timescales, a sampling rate around 1 kHz would be more than sufficient to capture the dynamics of the pendulum swing. This is based on the Nyquist theorem, which states that the sampling frequency should be at least twice the maximum frequency content of the signal.\n\n- **Digital Interface**: SPI or I2C interfaces are common for ADCs and are well-supported by most microcontrollers. The choice between them can typically be based on the preference for simplicity and the number of devices in the system (I2C for multiple devices on the same bus) or speed and distance (SPI for higher speeds and longer distances).\n\n- **Input Impedance**: The ADC should have a high input impedance to not load the previous analog stage. Typically, ADC input impedance is in the MΩ range, which is usually sufficient when following a buffer.\n\n- **Reference Voltage**: For precision measurements, an external reference voltage is often preferred for its stability and accuracy. However, many ADCs include an internal reference that is adequate for less demanding applications. The reference voltage should be chosen based on the maximum input range of the ADC, which in this case should be slightly above the maximum of ±7V to ensure the full range is utilized without clipping.\n\nBased on these general recommendations, a typical ADC suitable for this application might have the following specifications:\n\n- Resolution: 12-bit\n- Sampling Rate: ≥1 kHz\n- Digital Interface: SPI or I2C (depending on system requirements)\n- Input Impedance: ≥1 MΩ\n- Reference Voltage: Internal or external, depending on required accuracy, with a value slightly above ±7V.\n\nIt should be noted that if more specific requirements are known, these recommendations might need to be adjusted accordingly.\n```",

A model such as the Bourns PTA series could be appropriate. These types of potentiometers have a long life cycle, good resistance to environmental factors, and they are widely available.\n\nFor instance, the Bourns PTA4543-2015DP-A103 (10K ohm) would be a good choice, which has a linear taper and is designed for panel controls or other applications requiring a robust, reliable potentiometer.\n\nTo define a potentiometer more specifically:\n- **Resolution**: As a continuous analog device, the resolution of the potentiometer is limited only by the noise floor and the resolution of the DAQ system it is connected to.\n- **Sensitivity**: This relates to the change in output voltage per degree of pendulum movement. The sensitivity can be calculated by dividing the potentiometer's total voltage range by its mechanical angle range.\n- **Mechanical Durability**: Without specific requirements, it's best to select a potentiometer with a high cycle life, typically in the millions of cycles.\n- **Temperature Range**: A standard industrial grade potentiometer, such as the one suggested, typically operates between -55°C to +125°C, which should suit most environments. If the project involves extreme temperatures, a potentiometer with a specified temperature range beyond these values should be chosen.\n\nNote: Since there is no specific information on the environmental conditions, the suggestion is based on general industrial conditions. If the project will operate in harsh environments, potentiometers designed for those conditions should be considered.\n```",

The buffer stage will be a unity gain amplifier using an operational amplifier (op-amp). It will isolate the potentiometer from the rest of the signal chain, ensuring that the varying impedance of the potentiometer does not affect the subsequent stages.\n\nGiven the lack of details regarding the DAQ's input impedance, we will assume a typical value and ensure that the buffer's output impedance is significantly lower. This will prevent loading effects and maintain signal integrity. We will choose an op-amp with low output impedance—usually in the range of a few ohms.\n\nTopology Suggestions:\n- Non-Inverting Unity Gain Configuration (Voltage Follower)\n\nParameter Values:\n- Op-amp Selection: General-purpose, Rail-to-Rail Output op-amp (e.g., LM324, TLV2372)\n- Input Resistance (Rin): Not applicable for voltage follower configuration as feedback is directly from output to inverting input.\n- Feedback Resistance (Rf): Not applicable for voltage follower configuration.\n- Power Supply Voltage: Assuming standard supply voltages, +/- 15V or +/-12V power supplies should be sufficient, given that the potentiometer operates up to 10V and the buffer should not introduce any gain.\n\nGiven that power consumption, bandwidth, and temperature constraints are not specified, we will select a general-purpose op-amp with a wide operating temperature range and moderate power consumption. Rail-to-rail output is chosen to ensure the maximum dynamic range, particularly if the power supply available is limited in comparison to the op-amp's maximum ratings.\n\nIf the bandwidth or frequency response is later found to be an issue, additional compensation may be required to ensure stability and appropriate transient response. In the absence of bandwidth and environmental conditions, we will assume ambient temperature operation and a bandwidth sufficient for capturing the pendulum's motion, which is typically low frequency. If power consumption becomes a concern, low-power op-amps can be substituted with a trade-off against bandwidth and slew rate.\n```",

Without the DAQ's input impedance, an assumption must be made that it is high enough not to significantly load the attenuator.\n\nSince no specific information was provided regarding whether the attenuator should be adjustable or if there are accuracy and stability requirements, a simple passive attenuator will be designed. A passive attenuator is reliable, straightforward to implement, and does not require power.\n\nThe attenuation factor (AF) required can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAF = V_in_max / V_out_max\nAF = 10V / 7V\nAF ≈ 1.43\n\nNow, we can select standard resistor values to create a voltage divider that provides close to the desired attenuation factor. A typical configuration would be:\n\nR1 connects to the potentiometer output, and R2 connects to ground, with the node between R1 and R2 providing the attenuated output.\n\nUsing the voltage divider formula V_out = V_in * (R2 / (R1 + R2)) and the desired attenuation factor:\n\n7V = 10V * (R2 / (R1 + R2))\n1 / 1.43 = R2 / (R1 + R2)\n\nChoosing a standard value for R2, one can calculate the required R1:\n\nIf R2 = 10 kΩ, then R1 + R2 = (10 kΩ) * AF = 14.3 kΩ\nTherefore, R1 ≈ 14.3 kΩ - 10 kΩ = 4.3 kΩ\n\nThe closest standard 1% resistor value for R1 is 4.32 kΩ. So, the attenuator would consist of:\n\nR1 = 4.32 kΩ\nR2 = 10 kΩ\n\nThis would give a real attenuation factor of approximately:\n\nAF_actual = (R1 + R2) / R2 = (4.32 kΩ + 10 kΩ) / 10 kΩ ≈ 1.432\n\nThe output voltage at 135 degrees would then be approximately:\n\nV_out_max ≈ 10V / 1.432 ≈ 6.98V\n\nThis is slightly below the ±7V limit, providing a safety margin. However, if precise calibration is needed later, this can be achieved by slightly adjusting the values of R1 and R2, or by adding a trimmer resistor in series with R1.\n\nNote: If it turns out that the DAQ's input impedance is lower than expected and significantly loads the attenuator, affecting its performance, an active attenuator using an operational amplifier might be necessary. In such a case, a more complex design should be considered, potentially using an inverting or non-inverting amplifier configuration with a carefully chosen gain less than 1.\n```",

The notch filter will remove the 50 and 60 Hz mains interference, while the low-pass filter will provide a smooth output signal suitable for the DAQ.\n\nTOPOLOGY:\n- A Twin-T Notch Filter for attenuating the 50 and 60 Hz frequencies.\n- A Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter for the overall signal conditioning.\n\nTWIN-T NOTCH FILTER:\n- Target Frequency (f_notch): 50 Hz and 60 Hz (two separate notch filters or a switchable design).\n- Quality Factor (Q): Ideally between 2 to 5 to balance between sharp rejection and stability.\n- Component values will depend on the desired Q and the impedance levels of the circuit. These components include resistors and capacitors that resonate at the target frequencies.\n\nSALLEN-KEY LOW-PASS FILTER:\n- Cut-off Frequency (f_c): Assuming the pendulum's maximum oscillation frequency is much lower than 50 Hz, a cut-off frequency of around 10 Hz would likely suffice.\n- Filter Order: Second order (provides a -12 dB/octave or -40 dB/decade roll-off).\n- Type: Butterworth for maximized flat response in passband.\n- Damping Factor (ζ): 0.707 for a maximally flat passband (no ripple).\n\nCOMPONENT SELECTION:\n- Resistors and Capacitors: To be calculated based on the desired Q for the notch filter and the cut-off frequency for the low-pass filter. The values will also need to take into account the driving capability of the buffer and the input impedance of the DAQ.\n- Operational Amplifiers (for an active Sallen-Key design): Low-noise op-amps with sufficient bandwidth to accommodate the low-pass filter frequency range and the DAQ input impedance.\n\nIt is important to note that the values for the components of each filter will need to be refined based on the specific parameters of the system once they are known. These include the maximum pendulum oscillation frequency, the desired signal preservation requirements, and the impedance characteristics of the overall circuit. Without these specifics, the provided suggestions are based on typical values that would ensure a clean signal for a typical low-frequency measurement system while eliminating common noise sources such as mains interference.\n```",

        "content": "```Details\nADC_BLOCK\n\nGiven the lack of specific requirements for the ADC, we must make general assumptions based on the context to suggest an ADC implementation. Here are the suggestions based on typical requirements for the described application:\n\n- **Resolution**: Assuming that the pendulum angle measurements do not need to be extremely precise, a 12-bit ADC would typically provide sufficient resolution for most control and monitoring applications. This will provide a resolution of 4096 levels across the voltage range. If the pendulum's angle range is from 45 to 135 degrees, this equates to approximately 0.022 degrees per level, which is generally adequate for such measurements.\n\n- **Sampling Rate**: For a pendulum application, where the motion is relatively slow compared to electronic timescales, a sampling rate around 1 kHz would be more than sufficient to capture the dynamics of the pendulum swing. This is based on the Nyquist theorem, which states that the sampling frequency should be at least twice the maximum frequency content of the signal.\n\n- **Digital Interface**: SPI or I2C interfaces are common for ADCs and are well-supported by most microcontrollers. The choice between them can typically be based on the preference for simplicity and the number of devices in the system (I2C for multiple devices on the same bus) or speed and distance (SPI for higher speeds and longer distances).\n\n- **Input Impedance**: The ADC should have a high input impedance to not load the previous analog stage. Typically, ADC input impedance is in the MΩ range, which is usually sufficient when following a buffer.\n\n- **Reference Voltage**: For precision measurements, an external reference voltage is often preferred for its stability and accuracy. However, many ADCs include an internal reference that is adequate for less demanding applications. The reference voltage should be chosen based on the maximum input range of the ADC, which in this case should be slightly above the maximum of ±7V to ensure the full range is utilized without clipping.\n\nBased on these general recommendations, a typical ADC suitable for this application might have the following specifications:\n\n- Resolution: 12-bit\n- Sampling Rate: ≥1 kHz\n- Digital Interface: SPI or I2C (depending on system requirements)\n- Input Impedance: ≥1 MΩ\n- Reference Voltage: Internal or external, depending on required accuracy, with a value slightly above ±7V.\n\nIt should be noted that if more specific requirements are known, these recommendations might need to be adjusted accordingly.\n```",

A model such as the Bourns PTA series could be appropriate. These types of potentiometers have a long life cycle, good resistance to environmental factors, and they are widely available.\n\nFor instance, the Bourns PTA4543-2015DP-A103 (10K ohm) would be a good choice, which has a linear taper and is designed for panel controls or other applications requiring a robust, reliable potentiometer.\n\nTo define a potentiometer more specifically:\n- **Resolution**: As a continuous analog device, the resolution of the potentiometer is limited only by the noise floor and the resolution of the DAQ system it is connected to.\n- **Sensitivity**: This relates to the change in output voltage per degree of pendulum movement. The sensitivity can be calculated by dividing the potentiometer's total voltage range by its mechanical angle range.\n- **Mechanical Durability**: Without specific requirements, it's best to select a potentiometer with a high cycle life, typically in the millions of cycles.\n- **Temperature Range**: A standard industrial grade potentiometer, such as the one suggested, typically operates between -55°C to +125°C, which should suit most environments. If the project involves extreme temperatures, a potentiometer with a specified temperature range beyond these values should be chosen.\n\nNote: Since there is no specific information on the environmental conditions, the suggestion is based on general industrial conditions.

Without the DAQ's input impedance, an assumption must be made that it is high enough not to significantly load the attenuator.\n\nSince no specific information was provided regarding whether the attenuator should be adjustable or if there are accuracy and stability requirements, a simple passive attenuator will be designed. A passive attenuator is reliable, straightforward to implement, and does not require power.\n\nThe attenuation factor (AF) required can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAF = V_in_max / V_out_max\nAF = 10V / 7V\nAF ≈ 1.43\n\nNow, we can select standard resistor values to create a voltage divider that provides close to the desired attenuation factor. A typical configuration would be:\n\nR1 connects to the potentiometer output, and R2 connects to ground, with the node between R1 and R2 providing the attenuated output.\n\nUsing the voltage divider formula V_out = V_in * (R2 / (R1 + R2)) and the desired attenuation factor:\n\n7V = 10V * (R2 / (R1 + R2))\n1 / 1.43 = R2 / (R1 + R2)\n\nChoosing a standard value for R2, one can calculate the required R1:\n\nIf R2 = 10 kΩ, then R1 + R2 = (10 kΩ) * AF = 14.3 kΩ\nTherefore, R1 ≈ 14.3 kΩ - 10 kΩ = 4.3 kΩ\n\nThe closest standard 1% resistor value for R1 is 4.32 kΩ. So, the attenuator would consist of:\n\nR1 = 4.32 kΩ\nR2 = 10 kΩ\n\nThis would give a real attenuation factor of approximately:\n\nAF_actual = (R1 + R2) / R2 = (4.32 kΩ + 10 kΩ) / 10 kΩ ≈ 1.432\n\nThe output voltage at 135 degrees would then be approximately:\n\nV_out_max ≈ 10V / 1.432 ≈ 6.98V\n\nThis is slightly below the ±7V limit, providing a safety margin. However, if precise calibration is needed later, this can be achieved by slightly adjusting the values of R1 and R2, or by adding a trimmer resistor in series with R1.\n\nNote: If it turns out that the DAQ's input impedance is lower than expected and significantly loads the attenuator, affecting its performance, an active attenuator using an operational amplifier might be necessary. In such a case, a more complex design should be considered, potentially using an inverting or non-inverting amplifier configuration with a carefully chosen gain less than 1.\n```",

As the pendulum swings, it moves the wiper of the potentiometer and varies the resistance, subsequently altering the output voltage in proportion to the angle.\n\n**Buffer (Unity Gain)**: This buffer amplifies the signal from the potentiometer with a gain of one, also known as a voltage follower. Its main purpose is to prevent the potentiometer's output impedance from affecting subsequent stages and to provide a low-impedance output for better driving capability.\n\n**Attenuator (Voltage Divider)**: The attenuator scales down the voltage from the potentiometer to match the input range of the DAQ. It essentially divides the voltage to ensure that the output does not exceed ±7V, which is within the DAQ's acceptable range.\n\n**Low-Pass Filter (50/60 Hz Notch)**: This filter attenuates unwanted frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which are typical noise frequencies from electrical mains. It helps in reducing signal noise and interference to improve the quality of the signal being analyzed by the DAQ.\n\n**DAQ (Input ±7V)**: This is the data acquisition system that receives the conditioned analog signal representing the pendulum's angle.

The notch filter will remove the 50 and 60 Hz mains interference, while the low-pass filter will provide a smooth output signal suitable for the DAQ.\n\nTOPOLOGY:\n- A Twin-T Notch Filter for attenuating the 50 and 60 Hz frequencies.\n- A Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter for the overall signal conditioning.\n\nTWIN-T NOTCH FILTER:\n- Target Frequency (f_notch): 50 Hz and 60 Hz (two separate notch filters or a switchable design).\n- Quality Factor (Q): Ideally between 2 to 5 to balance between sharp rejection and stability.\n- Component values will depend on the desired Q and the impedance levels of the circuit. These components include resistors and capacitors that resonate at the target frequencies.\n\nSALLEN-KEY LOW-PASS FILTER:\n- Cut-off Frequency (f_c): Assuming the pendulum's maximum oscillation frequency is much lower than 50 Hz, a cut-off frequency of around 10 Hz would likely suffice.\n- Filter Order: Second order (provides a -12 dB/octave or -40 dB/decade roll-off).\n- Type: Butterworth for maximized flat response in passband.\n- Damping Factor (ζ): 0.707 for a maximally flat passband (no ripple).\n\nCOMPONENT SELECTION:\n- Resistors and Capacitors: To be calculated based on the desired Q for the notch filter and the cut-off frequency for the low-pass filter. The values will also need to take into account the driving capability of the buffer and the input impedance of the DAQ.\n- Operational Amplifiers (for an active Sallen-Key design): Low-noise op-amps with sufficient bandwidth to accommodate the low-pass filter frequency range and the DAQ input impedance.\n\nIt is important to note that the values for the components of each filter will need to be refined based on the specific parameters of the system once they are known. These include the maximum pendulum oscillation frequency, the desired signal preservation requirements, and the impedance characteristics of the overall circuit.

Here are the suggestions based on typical requirements for the described application:\n\n- **Resolution**: Assuming that the pendulum angle measurements do not need to be extremely precise, a 12-bit ADC would typically provide sufficient resolution for most control and monitoring applications. This will provide a resolution of 4096 levels across the voltage range. If the pendulum's angle range is from 45 to 135 degrees, this equates to approximately 0.022 degrees per level, which is generally adequate for such measurements.\n\n- **Sampling Rate**: For a pendulum application, where the motion is relatively slow compared to electronic timescales, a sampling rate around 1 kHz would be more than sufficient to capture the dynamics of the pendulum swing. This is based on the Nyquist theorem, which states that the sampling frequency should be at least twice the maximum frequency content of the signal.\n\n- **Digital Interface**: SPI or I2C interfaces are common for ADCs and are well-supported by most microcontrollers. The choice between them can typically be based on the preference for simplicity and the number of devices in the system (I2C for multiple devices on the same bus) or speed and distance (SPI for higher speeds and longer distances).\n\n- **Input Impedance**: The ADC should have a high input impedance to not load the previous analog stage. Typically, ADC input impedance is in the MΩ range, which is usually sufficient when following a buffer.\n\n- **Reference Voltage**: For precision measurements, an external reference voltage is often preferred for its stability and accuracy. However, many ADCs include an internal reference that is adequate for less demanding applications. The reference voltage should be chosen based on the maximum input range of the ADC, which in this case should be slightly above the maximum of ±7V to ensure the full range is utilized without clipping.\n\nBased on these general recommendations, a typical ADC suitable for this application might have the following specifications:\n\n- Resolution: 12-bit\n- Sampling Rate: ≥1 kHz\n- Digital Interface: SPI or I2C (depending on system requirements)\n- Input Impedance: ≥1 MΩ\n- Reference Voltage: Internal or external, depending on required accuracy, with a value slightly above ±7V.\n\nIt should be noted that if more specific requirements are known, these recommendations might need to be adjusted accordingly.\n```"

The sensitivity can be calculated by dividing the potentiometer's total voltage range by its mechanical angle range.\n- **Mechanical Durability**: Without specific requirements, it's best to select a potentiometer with a high cycle life, typically in the millions of cycles.\n- **Temperature Range**: A standard industrial grade potentiometer, such as the one suggested, typically operates between -55°C to +125°C, which should suit most environments.

Without the DAQ's input impedance, an assumption must be made that it is high enough not to significantly load the attenuator.\n\nSince no specific information was provided regarding whether the attenuator should be adjustable or if there are accuracy and stability requirements, a simple passive attenuator will be designed. A passive attenuator is reliable, straightforward to implement, and does not require power.\n\nThe attenuation factor (AF) required can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAF = V_in_max / V_out_max\nAF = 10V / 7V\nAF ≈ 1.43\n\nNow, we can select standard resistor values to create a voltage divider that provides close to the desired attenuation factor. A typical configuration would be:\n\nR1 connects to the potentiometer output, and R2 connects to ground, with the node between R1 and R2 providing the attenuated output.\n\nUsing the voltage divider formula V_out = V_in * (R2 / (R1 + R2)) and the desired attenuation factor:\n\n7V = 10V * (R2 / (R1 + R2))\n1 / 1.43 = R2 / (R1 + R2)\n\nChoosing a standard value for R2, one can calculate the required R1:\n\nIf R2 = 10 kΩ, then R1 + R2 = (10 kΩ) * AF = 14.3 kΩ\nTherefore, R1 ≈ 14.3 kΩ - 10 kΩ = 4.3 kΩ\n\nThe closest standard 1% resistor value for R1 is 4.32 kΩ. So, the attenuator would consist of:\n\nR1 = 4.32 kΩ\nR2 = 10 kΩ\n\nThis would give a real attenuation factor of approximately:\n\nAF_actual = (R1 + R2) / R2 = (4.32 kΩ + 10 kΩ) / 10 kΩ ≈ 1.432\n\nThe output voltage at 135 degrees would then be approximately:\n\nV_out_max ≈ 10V / 1.432 ≈ 6.98V\n\nThis is slightly below the ±7V limit, providing a safety margin. However, if precise calibration is needed later, this can be achieved by slightly adjusting the values of R1 and R2, or by adding a trimmer resistor in series with R1.\n\nNote: If it turns out that the DAQ's input impedance is lower than expected and significantly loads the attenuator, affecting its performance, an active attenuator using an operational amplifier might be necessary. In such a case, a more complex design should be considered, potentially using an inverting or non-inverting amplifier configuration with a carefully chosen gain less than 1.\n```"

    "response": "```Summary\nPendulum Angle Measurement System Design\n\nThis design summary outlines the proposed architecture and component selection for a system that calculates the angle of a pendulum using a linear potentiometer. The analog output is conditioned to be compatible with a Data Acquisition System (DAQ) that accepts a ±7V input.\n\nPotentiometer:\nA high-precision linear potentiometer is recommended for measuring the pendulum angle. It will provide a variable resistance corresponding to the pendulum's position within a 45 to 135-degree range. A suggested model is the Bourns PTA4543-2015DP-A103, which offers a 10K ohm resistance and is designed for robust, reliable operation.\n\nBuffer (Unity Gain Amplifier):\nThe buffer stage will consist of a non-inverting unity gain configuration using a general-purpose, rail-to-rail output operational amplifier such as the LM324 or TLV2372. This buffer isolates the potentiometer from the rest of the signal chain, ensuring that the varying impedance of the potentiometer does not affect subsequent stages. The power supply voltage for the op-amp will be selected based on the available values, ideally +/- 15V or +/-12V.\n\nAttenuator (Voltage Divider):\nTo match the output of the potentiometer to the DAQ's input range, a passive attenuator using a voltage divider is proposed. The required attenuation factor (AF) is calculated as follows:\n\nAF = V_in_max / V_out_max = 10V / 7V ≈ 1.43\n\nSelecting standard resistor values for the voltage divider, we calculate:\n\nR1 = 4.32 kΩ (closest standard value to achieve the desired attenuation)\nR2 = 10 kΩ\n\nThis configuration gives a real attenuation factor of approximately 1.432, producing a maximum output voltage of about 6.98V when the potentiometer is at 10V, slightly below the ±7V limit.\n\nLow-Pass Filter:\nA Twin-T Notch Filter will handle the attenuation of 50 and 60 Hz frequencies, while a Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter will condition the overall signal. The notch filter will be designed for a quality factor (Q) between 2 to 5, targeting the specific frequencies. For the low-pass filter, a second-order Butterworth configuration is suggested, with a cut-off frequency (f_c) of around 10 Hz, which is sufficiently above the pendulum's maximum swing frequency and provides a flat passband response.\n\nADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter):\nA 12-bit ADC with a sampling rate greater than 1 kHz is recommended for digitizing the conditioned signal. An ADC with a high input impedance (\u003e1 MΩ) and an SPI or I2C digital interface is ideal. It should have an internal or external reference voltage slightly above ±7V for accurate and stable measurements.\n\nThe system is designed with general industrial conditions in mind; if specific environmental or power considerations arise, components should be selected to match those requirements.\n```\n",
