    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary for the pendulum angle measurement system design outlines several key components and considerations, addressing the requirements in varying degrees of detail:\n\n1. The use of a potentiometer in a voltage divider is implicit in the description but not explicitly stated.\n2. The power supply for the buffer stage is +/- 10V, which aligns with the voltage applied to the potentiometer requirement.\n3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, an anti-aliasing filter, and DAQ measurement, which is simple as required.\n4. The amplifier design indicates a gain of 0.7, which, when applied to the maximum potentiometer voltage of 10V, would result in a maximum output voltage of 7V, centered at 0V as needed.\n5. The protection circuit design includes a TVS diode with a standoff voltage of 7.5V, which, along with a series resistor, should ensure that the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ does not exceed 7V.\n6. An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz is included, suggesting that it would prevent aliasing.\n7. The filter design incorporates a Twin-T Notch Filter specifically targeting 50 Hz and 60 Hz frequencies, which would remove unwanted noise in that range.\n8. Although the order of the filter is not explicitly stated, the use of an active Twin-T Notch Filter for two specific frequencies implies at least a second-order filter for each frequency, potentially meeting the requirement for a total order of at least 3.\n\nHowever, the project summary does not explicitly state whether the combination of the anti-aliasing filter and the notch filter meets the minimum total order of 3. Additionally, while the summary describes a protection circuit, it does not explicitly confirm that it will ensure the DAQ's input voltage limits are never exceeded, which is a crucial aspect of the design. Lastly, the summary does not mention if the potentiometer is part of a voltage divider, which is a requirement.\n\nBased on the information provided, the project seems to be well thought out, with proper attention to component selection and detailed design considerations. However, without explicit confirmation on the order of the filters and the voltage divider configuration, the project cannot be rated as 'optimal'. It is also not 'incorrect' or 'unfeasible' as the design appears to be theoretically correct and implementable. Therefore, the verdict is 'acceptable', considering the project can be implemented with no fatal issues identified, but there is not enough detail to confirm perfect alignment with all requirements.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
