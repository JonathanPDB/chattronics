Score: 8
Explanations: 
1. The output being measured by a digital multimeter (DMM) is mentioned, which satisfies the requirement of measuring the output.
2. The gain stage block is explicitly described with a gain calculation of Av = 20 (20V / 1V), which satisfies the requirement for an amplification stage and gain justification.
3. The output voltage range is specified to be 0-20V, which meets the required output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter.
4. The linearization resistor (R_lin) is chosen to match the thermistor resistance at 50°C, which is the specified midrange, thus fulfilling the requirement of optimizing the linearization resistor for 50°C.
5. The linearization block is present, and a specific method to linearize the NTC is described, which is necessary and satisfies the requirement.
6. The architecture described consists of a sensor (NTC), linearization stage, amplification, and optional filtering before measurement, which aligns with the required architecture.
7. The sensor used is a Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor, which is an NTC and meets the requirement.
8. The maximum operating current is specified to be below 0.5mA to minimize self-heating, which acknowledges the self-heating effect and satisfies the requirement of knowing the maximum current through the NTC.

All eight requirements are covered by the project summary provided.
