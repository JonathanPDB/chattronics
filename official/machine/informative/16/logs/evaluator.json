    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary covers the following requirements:\n\n1. Both sensors have d.c. output - This is implicit in the description of the strain-gauge pressure sensor and the infrared radiation detectors, which typically provide a DC output proportional to the measured quantity. No mention of demodulation is made, so this requirement is met.\n2. Both sensors must be amplified - The pressure sensor is amplified using an instrumentation amplifier with a gain of 5000, and the temperature sensor is amplified with a gain of 50. This requirement is met.\n3. The pressure sensor must be inserted in a Wheatstone bridge and amplified by an instrumentation amplifier - While it mentions an instrumentation amplifier (AD620), the summary does not explicitly state that the pressure sensor is part of a Wheatstone bridge configuration. This requirement is not clearly met.\n4. An ADC should be used - The summary mentions a 16-bit SAR ADC with a sampling rate of at least 2 kSPS. This requirement is met.\n5. Infrared radiation sensors are being linearized - The summary indicates that nonlinearity correction for the temperature sensor is addressed digitally post-ADC or with a DAC controlled by a microcontroller. This requirement is met.\n6. The solution mentions the sampling order strategy - The summary does not explicitly mention the sampling order strategy (sequential, simultaneous, etc.). This requirement is not met.\n7. The sampling frequency of the ADC is not less than 800 Hz - The ADC has a sampling rate of at least 2 kSPS, which is above the required 800 Hz. This requirement is met.\n8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency - The anti-aliasing filter is a fourth-order Butterworth with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz. However, without knowing the sampling frequency, we cannot confirm if the gain is at least -20 dB at half the sampling frequency. Assuming a 2 kSPS sampling rate (the minimum specified), the half sampling frequency would be 1 kHz. A fourth-order Butterworth filter has a slope of 80 dB/decade, but the requirement is not precisely quantifiable with the information provided. This requirement is not clearly met.\n9. The low-pass cutoff frequency is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency - The cutoff frequency for both the pressure and temperature signal conditioning filters is 500 Hz, which is higher than 400 Hz and lower than half the total sampling frequency (assuming a minimum of 2 kSPS). This requirement is met.\n10. There are low-pass filters positioned before the multiplexer(s) - The summary mentions RC low-pass filters with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz for both the pressure and temperature signal conditioning blocks. This requirement is met.\n11. The project uses multiplexers to choose channels - A 16-to-1 CMOS analog multiplexer is mentioned in the summary. This requirement is met.\n12. The multiplexers are solid state - The CD74HC4067 is a CMOS analog multiplexer, which is a solid-state device. This requirement is met.\n\nIn summary, the project summary meets 10 out of the 12 requirements listed. It does not clearly meet the requirement related to the Wheatstone bridge configuration for the pressure sensor (requirement 3) and does not mention the sampling order strategy (requirement 6). The anti-aliasing filter's performance at half the sampling frequency (requirement 8) cannot be confirmed with the information provided, but given the benefit of the doubt on the filter's performance, it seems to be within the acceptable range.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n10\n```",
