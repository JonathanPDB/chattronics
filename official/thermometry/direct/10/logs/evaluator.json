    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary covers the following requirements:\n\n1. The output is being measured by a multimeter: The project mentions the use of a multimeter capable of measuring 0-20 volts DC, which is the output voltage range.\n2. There should be an amplification stage and the gain must be provided and justified: The gain stage is described with a non-inverting amplifier configuration, and the gain is calculated to be approximately 22 to achieve the 0-20V output range from a linearization output range of 0.1V to 0.9V.\n3. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is between 0 and 20 Volts: The output stage is designed to amplify the signal to the required 0-20V output range.\n4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC: A precision metal film resistor of 6.2kΩ is used for linearization at the 50°C midpoint.\n5. The NTC is linearized (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false): The linearization is explicitly mentioned and a resistor value is chosen for this purpose.\n6. The architecture should be roughly consisting of the sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering, and measurement: The project describes an architecture with a sensor (NTC thermistor), linearization stage (Wheatstone bridge with linearization resistor), amplification (gain stage), and measurement (multimeter).\n7. The sensor used is an NTC (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false): The sensor is specified as an NTC thermistor (Vishay NTCLE100E3).\n8. The self-heating effect is taken into account and there the maximum current that passes through the NTC is known: The project does not explicitly state the consideration of the self-heating effect or the maximum current that passes through the NTC, which is a requirement that is not met in the summary provided.\n\nBased on the information provided, the project meets 7 out of 8 requirements. The only requirement not met is the consideration of the self-heating effect and the specification of the maximum current through the NTC.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n7\n```",
