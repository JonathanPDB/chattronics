    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary outlines a pendulum angle measurement system that uses a potentiometer, a voltage buffer, a low-pass filter, an anti-aliasing filter, and a DAQ system. Let's analyze the requirements:\n\n1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider and its output linearly changes from -5 V to 5 V, which meets the requirement of using it as a voltage divider, although the voltage range is reduced from the +/- 10 V supply.\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is unclear, as the output is specified to be from -5 V to 5 V, which does not match the requirement of +/- 10 V.\n3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, a buffer, and a filter before the DAQ, which meets the basic architecture requirement.\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ needs to be centered at 0, but the provided voltage range from the potentiometer is -5 V to 5 V, which does not reach the required +/- 7 V.\n5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is not specified to be limited to 7 V, which could be problematic if the system allows higher voltages to reach the DAQ.\n6. The anti-aliasing filter is present, meeting the requirement to avoid aliasing.\n7. The filter does not explicitly mention removing frequencies between 50 and 60 Hz, which is a requirement for the system.\n8. The cutoff frequency for the anti-aliasing filter is 250 Hz, which is lower than the specified requirement of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, but without knowing the order of the filter or the actual attenuation at 500 Hz, it's unclear if this requirement is met.\n\nGiven the information provided, the project does not fully meet all the specified requirements, particularly regarding the voltage levels applied to and measured by the DAQ and the specific filtering of 50 and 60 Hz noise. It is also not clear if the maximum voltage to the DAQ is sufficiently limited to 7 V, which is a critical requirement.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nunfeasible\n```",
