Instrumentation Amplifier Array for Pressure:

Low-Pass Filter for Pressure:
- Topology: Second-order or Fourth-order Butterworth
- Cutoff Frequency: Set to 350 Hz to pass signal frequencies up to 400 Hz
- Components: Based on a chosen op-amp (e.g., NE5532), resistors, and capacitors calculated for the desired cutoff frequency

Low-Pass Filter for Temperature:
- Topology: Second-order or Fourth-order Butterworth
- Cutoff Frequency: Set to 450 Hz to ensure passband includes signal frequencies up to 400 Hz
- Components: Chosen based on the selected op-amp characteristics

ADC for Pressure (ADC_Pressure):
- Resolution: 12-bit to 16-bit to achieve 1% accuracy

ADC for Temperature (ADC_Temp):
- Resolution: 12-bit or higher to resolve 1 mV changes in sensor output
- Sampling Rate: ≥ 10 samples per second per channel
- Input Range: 0 to 100 mV to match sensor output
- Type: SAR ADC
- Voltage Reference: Integrated preferred, or an external precision reference

Microcontroller:
- The microcontroller should have sufficient analog input channels and computational power to handle data throughput and signal processing tasks.
- Communication protocols: UART, SPI, I2C or USB, based on available hardware and computer system requirements.
- Data Processing: Capability for basic digital signal processing functions before data transmission.
- Operating Conditions: Generally, an industrial-rated microcontroller should be used if no specific environmental conditions are provided.

Software and Tools:
- Development IDEs: Microchip MPLAB X, Keil µVision, or Arduino IDE
- Simulation Software: Proteus, MATLAB/Simulink
- Version Control: Git for source code management
- Communication Tools: PuTTY or Tera Term, and SPI/I2C debugging tools
