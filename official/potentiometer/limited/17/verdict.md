Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a comprehensive system design for measuring the angle of a pendulum using a potentiometer and subsequent signal conditioning before digitization by a DAQ. However, there are several points to consider in relation to the requirements provided:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, which is correct.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V, which is within the specified range.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, a buffer, and an anti-aliasing filter before the DAQ, satisfying simplicity.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, with a range of +/- 7V, meeting the required specification.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is designed to be 7V, which is essential and has been accounted for in the design.
6. There is a low-pass filter in place to prevent aliasing, which is correct.
7. The design includes a notch filter to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which is correct.
8. The low-pass filter is a second-order Butterworth with a cutoff frequency of 200 Hz, which might not provide the required -20 dB attenuation at 500 Hz. A second-order Butterworth filter has a roll-off of -12 dB per octave. Since one octave above 200 Hz is 400 Hz, the attenuation at 500 Hz would be less than -20 dB. To achieve -20 dB at 500 Hz, a higher-order filter or a steeper roll-off rate would be necessary.

Given that the low-pass filter does not meet the -20 dB attenuation requirement at 500 Hz, the design does not fully meet all the listed requirements.
