Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water Beaker

The following is a compilation of the proposed architecture for measuring the temperature of water in a beaker using a thermistor and outputting a voltage readable by a multimeter:

Temperature Sensor Block:
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC Thermistor, commonly used variant with 10 kΩ nominal resistance at 25°C and a beta value of approximately 3977 K.
- Implementation: The thermistor forms part of a voltage divider and is biased with a constant current source. The voltage across the thermistor is linearly related to temperature, and calibration may be required for accurate readings.

Constant Current Source Block:
- Design Approach: A simple transistor-based constant current source can be used to bias the thermistor.
- Assumed Biasing Current: Typically 100 µA to 1 mA, chosen to minimize self-heating. In this design, 100 µA is used.
- Example Topology: PNP transistor with a base-emitter resistor setting the base current and the thermistor connected from the emitter to ground.

Signal Conditioning Amplifier Block:
- Amplifier Type: Instrumentation amplifier chosen for high input impedance and variable gain.
- Gain Calculation: Assuming a linear voltage range from the thermistor from 0-100mV, the gain is set to scale this to a 0-20V output range.
- Gain (Av): Assuming a 100mV input range, Av = 20V / 100mV = 200.

Output Scaling Amplifier Block:
- Amplifier Configuration: Non-inverting op-amp configuration.
- Power Supply: Bipolar supply, e.g., ±15V, or single supply greater than 20V for rail-to-rail op-amps.
- Gain Calculation: For a signal level in the millivolt range, a voltage gain of about 200 is needed to achieve a 0 to 20V output range.
- Components: Precision op-amp with low offset, feedback resistors with 0.1% tolerance, and protection elements such as clamping diodes and a fuse or PTC thermistor.

Anti-Aliasing Filter Block (Not Implemented):
- Not necessary for the initial implementation as the output is intended for a multimeter. However, a second-order passive low-pass Butterworth filter with a -3dB cutoff frequency at 1 Hz could be used, utilizing 15.9 kΩ resistors and 10 nF capacitors for temperature signals.

ADC Block (Not Implemented):
- The ADC is not implemented in the current design since the user's requirement is to output a voltage for a multimeter. If digital conversion becomes necessary, further requirements will be needed to select an ADC.

In conclusion, the architecture provided is based on typical values and standard practices for analog temperature measurement systems with NTC thermistors. Specific component values and topology selections were made based on assumptions due to a lack of detailed user specifications. Calibration and fine-tuning of the system are recommended once the actual components are selected and the system is operational.
