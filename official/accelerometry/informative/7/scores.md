Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) is 100 MΩ and the feedback capacitance (Cf) is 470 pF. The Rf x Cf product is 100e6 x 470e-12 = 0.047 seconds. The requirement is for this product to be around 2/pi (approximately 0.637), and thus, the product here is significantly lower than the target. This requirement is not met.

2. The charge amplifier gain (G) is not explicitly given, but we can estimate it based on the piezoelectric sensor's sensitivity and the required output voltage. Since the desired output voltage is 2.3V peak and the initial charge to voltage conversion is 100 μV for 100 pC, with a sensor sensitivity of 100 pC/g, the gain seems to be significantly higher than 1 when considering the multiplication by 1.61E-12 and division by the feedback capacitance. Without explicit values for the gain, it cannot be determined if this requirement is met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 402.7 pC, which is significantly higher than the specified 161 pC. This requirement is not met.

4. The bias current must be provided, but the project summary does not mention any specifics about the bias current being provided by the circuit. This requirement is not met.

5. The relationship between the bias current and the feedback resistance is not explicitly mentioned, and without information on the bias current, this requirement cannot be evaluated. This requirement is not met.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as indicated by the charge amplifier topology and the piezoelectric accelerometer specifications. This requirement is met.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, with calculations (e.g., expected peak acceleration) to back it up. This requirement is met.

8. The output voltage is specified to be 2.3V peak for the ADC input, which is higher than the 1 V peak to peak required. Without information on the final output after all stages, it cannot be determined if the output voltage is 1 V peak to peak. This requirement is not met.

9. There is no information provided about the offset voltage, other than that a low offset voltage operational amplifier is used. There is no explicit value or guarantee that the offset is kept below 10 mV. This requirement is not met.
