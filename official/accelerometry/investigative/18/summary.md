Design of a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Piezoelectric Accelerometer:
- Type: Piezoelectric accelerometer
- Model Suggestion: PCB Piezotronics Model 352C33
- Sensitivity: ≥ 100 mV/g to ensure detectability of small vibrations
- Measurement Range: ±1g, suitable for the specified peak motion of 5 cm
- Frequency Response: At least DC to 2 Hz, with a low-end response 3 dB down at 0.25 Hz
- Temperature Range: Typically -40 to +85°C
- Output: Voltage output from the integrated electronics piezo-electric (IEPE) sensor
- Power Requirements: 2 to 20 mA constant current excitation, 18 to 30 VDC

Charge Amplifier:
- Gain: Adjustable, starting point based on an assumed peak acceleration of 1g (9.81 m/s^2)
- Feedback Capacitor (C_f): 1 nF
- Feedback Resistor (R_f): 620 kOhms (calculated for a cutoff at 0.25 Hz)
- Op-Amp: Low input bias current, low noise, such as the LT1167 or AD8421
- Gain Calculation: Assuming 1 V output from 100 pC of charge, G = 10^7 V/C
- R_f Calculation for 0.25 Hz cutoff: R_f = 1 / (2 * π * 0.25 Hz * 1 nF) ≈ 636619.77 Ohms

Low-Pass Filter:
- Topology: Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter
- Order: First Order (single-pole)
- Cutoff Frequency: 0.25 Hz
- Component values: C1 = 10 uF, R1 ≈ 62 kΩ (chosen based on standard values)
- Operational Amplifier: Low noise and low power consumption, should be powered with a dual supply voltage

Anti-aliasing Filter:
- Filter Type: Second-order active Butterworth low-pass filter
- Cutoff Frequency: 5 Hz (selected based on an assumed ADC sampling rate)
- Attenuation: -12 dB at the cutoff frequency
- Component Selection: Standard values based on the operational amplifier used, ensuring low noise and power consumption

Analog to Digital Converter (ADC):
- Resolution: 16-bit for fine granularity
- Sampling Rate: ≥10 samples per second (10 Hz), assuming a Nyquist rate of at least twice the highest frequency component
- Accuracy: INL and DNL < 1 LSB for precision
- Interface: SPI for its simplicity and speed
- Power: Low-power operation with power-down mode for portability
- Package: Small form factor such as QSOP or TSSOP
- ADC Type: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) for a balance of speed, resolution, and power consumption

Summary of Steps:
1. Start by defining the accelerometer's sensitivity and the range of vibrations it needs to measure.
2. Design the charge amplifier based on the assumed peak acceleration and the desired output voltage.
3. Determine the feedback components for the charge amplifier to set the gain and the low-frequency cutoff.
4. Create a low-pass filter design with a cutoff frequency that preserves the frequencies of interest.
5. Select an active filter topology for the anti-aliasing filter to attenuate unwanted frequencies before ADC.
6. Recommend specifications for the ADC block based on a general understanding of the system requirements and common standards for portability.
7. Ensure all designs are compatible with each other, taking into account power supply constraints, environmental conditions, and interfacing requirements.
