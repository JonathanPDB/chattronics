    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary provides a comprehensive design for a pendulum angle measurement system, addressing most of the requirements specified. The potentiometer is being used as a sensor which likely implies a voltage divider configuration, fulfilling requirement 1. The voltage rating of the potentiometer is 10 V, which is within the specified range of requirement 2. The architecture includes a voltage follower (buffer), a scaling amplifier, low pass filters, notch filters, and a DAQ system, which aligns with requirement 3.\n\nHowever, the summary does not explicitly mention that the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V. It does imply that the scaling amplifier is designed to ensure the DAQ input is centered around 0V with a range of +/- 7V, which is an indirect indication that requirement 4 is met, but this is based on an assumption and not explicitly stated. Requirement 5 is critical, as the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ must not exceed 7V. Without explicit confirmation that this is the case, it's not possible to categorically state that this requirement is met.\n\nThe low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz and the notch filters for 50 Hz and 60 Hz are designed to prevent aliasing and remove unwanted frequencies, which satisfies requirements 6 and 7. The summary does not provide enough information to determine if the filter's attenuation at 500 Hz is at least -20 dB, leaving requirement 8 unverified.\n\nGiven the information provided, the summary does not explicitly verify that requirement 5 is met, which is essential, and does not provide enough detail to confirm that requirement 8 is satisfied. Therefore, the project cannot be classified as optimal. However, the overall design concept is theoretically correct, and with further clarification or adjustment, it could be implemented successfully.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
