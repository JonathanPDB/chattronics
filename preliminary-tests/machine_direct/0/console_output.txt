**Strain-Gauge Sensor**: The function of the strain-gauge is to convert the pressure changes on the machine's surface into an electrical signal. The sensor's sensitivity is designed to ensure that the maximum pressure corresponds to a maximum output of 1 mV.

**Instrumentation Amplifier**: This block is responsible for amplifying the very low voltage signal from the strain-gauge sensor. It should provide a high input impedance, low noise, and have a gain sufficient to amplify the 1 mV signal to a level that is suitable for subsequent processing.

**Low Pass Filter (Pressure)**: This filter removes frequencies higher than 400 Hz to prevent aliasing and noise above the signal frequency of interest from interfering with the measurement. It also ensures that the signal meets the Nyquist criterion when sampled by the ADC.

**Sample & Hold (Pressure)**: This circuit captures the analog signal at a specific moment in time, holding its value steady so that it can be accurately digitized by the ADC while the multiplexer switches channels.

**Infrared Detector**: The IR detector converts the radiation from the machine surface into an electrical signal. The output has a nonlinear relationship with temperature, and its maximum output is 100 mV.

**Logarithmic Amplifier**: Since the IR detector output is nonlinear, the logarithmic amplifier is used to linearize the temperature signal. This is important to ensure the accuracy of temperature readings is maintained across the sensor's range.

**Low Pass Filter (Temperature)**: Similar to the pressure measurement subsystem, this filter ensures that only frequencies up to 400 Hz are passed to the Sample & Hold circuit, maintaining the integrity of the temperature measurement.

**Sample & Hold (Temperature)**: It functions similarly to the Sample & Hold in the pressure subsystem, capturing the analog temperature signal for accurate ADC conversion.

**Analog Multiplexer**: This block is used to select one channel at a time from the multiple sensor inputs. As there are 16 total sensors (8 pressure and 8 temperature), the multiplexer must have at least 16 channels.

**Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**: The ADC converts the selected analog signal from the multiplexer into a digital signal for processing by a computer. The resolution and sampling rate of the ADC must be chosen to meet the 1% accuracy requirement of the sensors.

**Output to Computer**: This block represents the interface that sends the digitalized sensor data to the computer for analysis. This could be achieved through various digital communication protocols depending on the specific application requirements.

ANALOG MULTIPLEXER BLOCK

The Analog Multiplexer (MUX) is a crucial component in the data acquisition system, allowing one ADC to sequentially read multiple analog input channels. For this application, the MUX must switch between eight pressure sensor channels and eight temperature sensor channels, totaling 16 channels to be multiplexed. Since no additional channels were mentioned, we will not include extra channels for expansion.

Considering that the pressure and temperature sensors output a maximum of 1 mV and 100 mV, respectively, after signal conditioning (amplification and filtering), we expect these voltage levels to be brought to a range suitable for the ADC. Let's assume the output voltage levels from both sensor systems are scaled to be compatible with the ADC input range, typically 0-5V or 0-3.3V.

The switching speed of the MUX should be fast enough to allow the ADC to sample at its specified rate, which must be at least twice the highest signal frequency of 400 Hz (according to the Nyquist theorem). Given that there are 16 channels, and assuming a conservative ADC sampling rate of 1 kHz per channel to provide ample time for signal settling, the MUX must switch faster than 1 ms per channel.

The on-resistance and off-leakage current of the MUX should be low enough not to significantly affect the accuracy of the sensor signals. Precision MUXs with on-resistance in the range of tens to hundreds of ohms and negligible leakage currents will be suitable.

Given that there is no provided preference for package type, and considering ease of prototyping and availability, a standard DIP (Dual Inline Package) or SOIC (Small Outline Integrated Circuit) package can be used. The operating temperature range of the MUX should match or exceed the operating temperature range of the sensors and the environmental conditions of the machine.

We can consider the following high-level MUX specifications:
- At least 16 single-ended channels
- Compatible voltage level handling (after conditioning) for ADC (0-5V or 0-3.3V)
- Switching speed faster than 1ms per channel
- Low on-resistance and off-leakage current
- Package type: DIP or SOIC for ease of use and availability

A possible multiplexer choice could be the CD74HC4067 16-Channel Analog Multiplexer/Demultiplexer which comes in a 24-pin DIP or SOIC package, has a wide operating voltage range (2V to 6V), and fast switching speeds suitable for this application.

Here's the suggested topology:

- Each strain-gauge amplifier output connects to one of the first eight MUX inputs.
- Each temperature sensor signal conditioning output connects to one of the second set of eight MUX inputs.
- The MUX output connects to the ADC input.
- The control signals for the MUX (channel select and enable) are driven by a microcontroller or digital logic circuit, not discussed here but necessary for operation.

Values for the MUX, assuming a 5V ADC reference:
- On-resistance: typically <100 ohms for CD74HC4067
- Off-leakage current: typically negligible for accuracy requirements

Please note that the exact model of the MUX might change based on supply availability and specific ADC requirements, but the CD74HC4067 is a robust starting point for further design and optimization.

DIGITAL_PROCESSING_IMPLEMENTATION

Considering the lack of specific details on the computer interface and other requirements, we will proceed with widely accepted standards and flexible solutions in the design for the "Output to Computer" block.

1. Interface: USB 3.0 or Ethernet is recommended for the digital interface. USB 3.0 provides ease of use and is common in most computer systems, while Ethernet allows for longer distances between the data acquisition system and the computer and can be integrated into networked systems. For industrial applications, Ethernet is often preferred.

2. Data Format and Protocol: The data should be formatted in a way that is easily parsed by the receiving computer system. A common format is raw binary, which can be efficiently transferred and processed, but for easier debugging and compatibility, ASCII encoding may also be used. The data stream could use a simple custom protocol where each packet is prefixed with a header indicating the type of data (pressure or temperature) and the sensor index.

3. Latency and Real-time Constraints: To accommodate real-time processing, the system should ensure minimal latency. The use of a real-time operating system (RTOS) or a high-speed data acquisition card can help meet stringent timing requirements. If the application does not have hard real-time constraints, standard operating systems with proper buffering can be sufficient.

4. Buffering and Local Storage: Implementing a FIFO (first-in, first-out) buffer can be beneficial to accommodate momentary data bursts and to ensure no data is lost during high usage periods. The size of the buffer will depend on the potential data rates and the processing speed of the computer.

5. Computer Operating System and Software: The digital processing block should be designed to be compatible with multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) to ensure broad applicability. Driver and software development kits (SDKs) should follow standard programming interfaces, such as VISA for instrumentation, to ease integration into existing systems.

In the absence of specific user requirements, these recommendations provide a robust starting point for the digital processing block that balances performance, compatibility, and ease of integration.

Sample & Hold (Temperature) Block

Given the lack of specific details, the Sample & Hold (S&H) circuit for the temperature channel can be designed with some general assumptions. The main role of the S&H circuit is to capture and hold the analog signal from the Low Pass Filter (Temperature) long enough for the ADC to perform an accurate conversion.

Topology: A typical S&H topology includes an analog switch, a capacitor to hold the charge, and a buffer amplifier to drive the ADC.

1. Analog Switch: For temperature signals, which are typically low-frequency, a CMOS switch can be used due to its high input impedance and low on-resistance.

2. Hold Capacitor (CH): The value of the hold capacitor must be large enough to maintain the voltage during the hold time without degrading the signal by more than the allowable error (1% in this case). A common value might be in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 µF, with low leakage characteristics to minimize droop.

3. Buffer Amplifier: The buffer amplifier should have a high input impedance to avoid discharging the hold capacitor and a low output impedance to drive the ADC input. The amplifier should also have a fast settling time to ensure the output is stable before the ADC conversion starts.

4. Aperture Time: The acquisition time or aperture time is the interval during which the S&H circuit must track the input signal before holding. The aperture time should be as short as possible, typically in the range of a few microseconds or less, to minimize error due to signal changes during this period.

5. Sampling Rate: Ideally, the sampling rate for the ADC will be at least twice the maximum frequency of interest (400 Hz), so an 800 Hz minimum sampling rate would be a good starting point. However, to give more margin and ensure accurate reconstruction of the signal, we might choose a sampling rate several times higher, such as 2 kHz or more.

Suggested S&H Circuit Example:
- Analog Switch: CD4066 CMOS Quad Bilateral Switch
- Hold Capacitor: 0.47 µF, low leakage, ceramic or film capacitor
- Buffer Amplifier: OPAx333 Zero-Drift Operational Amplifier
- Aperture Time: < 2 µs

Note: The OPAx333 op-amp is recommended due to its low offset voltage, which will help in maintaining the 1% accuracy requirement. The CD4066 offers a good balance of on-resistance and bandwidth for low-frequency signal switching.

Environmental Factors: The S&H circuit should be designed with a temperature coefficient that matches the operating temperature range, ensuring stability and consistency in performance across varying temperatures.

Power and Size: Low power op-amps and switches should be selected for applications where power consumption is critical. The physical size of the components should be compatible with the available PCB space and the overall design compactness requirements.

INSTRUMENTATION_AMPLIFIER_BLOCK

Given the constraints and the requirement for 1% accuracy, the following are suitable specifications:

- Expected pressure measurement range: Typically, industrial applications might measure pressures up to 10,000 psi. However, pressure ranges are usually application-specific. For the purpose of this design, a mid-range pressure of 0 to 100 psi will be assumed, which should be converted to 0 to 5V range for ADC compatibility (common ADC reference voltage).
- Gain calculation: To amplify a 1 mV strain-gauge signal to a 0 to 5 V range, the amplifier needs a gain of 5000 (since 5V/1mV = 5000).
- Power supply voltages: ±15 V is a common supply for industrial amplifiers, providing enough headroom for amplification.
- Input impedance: The instrumentation amplifier should have a high input impedance, typically greater than 10 kΩ, to avoid loading the sensor.
- Output impedance: A low output impedance, less than 100 Ω, to drive the ADC without signal degradation.
- Temperature compensation: Since we lack specific sensor details, an amplifier with a low temperature coefficient is preferable to minimize drift.
- Noise tolerance and CMRR: A CMRR of at least 80 dB is desirable for industrial settings, with low noise characteristics to maintain the 1% accuracy.

Topology suggestions:
- Three-Op-Amp topology: Offers high gain accuracy, high CMRR, and is suitable for precision applications. It can be implemented with precision op-amps like the AD620 or INA118.
- Two-Op-Amp topology: Provides a good balance between performance and cost. Suitable op-amps include the AD623 or INA121.

Recommended configuration:
- Use precision resistors with 0.1% tolerance for the gain-setting resistors to maintain the 1% accuracy requirement.
- Include a potentiometer in the design for fine gain adjustment to calibrate the system during installation.
- Use a three-op-amp instrumentation amplifier configuration with a gain of 5000 to fulfill the accuracy and linearity requirements.
- Select an amplifier with an integrated offset-nulling capability to allow for fine-tuning and minimizing offset voltage errors.

LOW_PASS_FILTER_PRESSURE

Given the absence of specific requirements, we will design the low pass filter using standard values and reasonable assumptions for the pressure sensors signal conditioning.

- Topology: Active Butterworth filter topology will be used for its maximally flat frequency response in the passband, which provides no ripples and preserves the integrity of the pressure signal.

- Components: The filter will be implemented using operational amplifiers (op-amps), resistors, and capacitors. These components are readily available, reliable, and relatively low in cost. An active filter can also provide gain if necessary and is less affected by component tolerances than a passive filter.

- Filter order: A second-order (two-pole) filter is a common choice that provides a balance between complexity and filtering performance. It offers a 12 dB/octave (40 dB/decade) roll-off, which is often sufficient to attenuate unwanted frequency components.

- Cutoff frequency: The cutoff frequency (fc) will be set slightly below 400 Hz to ensure that any frequencies at 400 Hz and above are adequately attenuated. A reasonable choice would be fc = 350 Hz, allowing a transition band before reaching the 400 Hz limit.

- Attenuation: Standard attenuation for a second-order filter is 12 dB/octave beyond the cutoff frequency. By the time we reach 400 Hz, we would have a minimal attenuation. If we need a sharper attenuation, we could consider a higher-order filter.

Based on these parameters, component values (resistors R and capacitors C) for the filter can be calculated using standard filter design equations:

Sample & Hold Block for Pressure Measurement

Based on the requirements for monitoring pressure with a maximum sensor output of 1 mV and an expected signal frequency of 400 Hz, the Sample & Hold (S&H) block must accurately capture the analog signal at specific intervals to allow for precise digitization by the ADC.

Since we are aiming for an accuracy of 1%, and considering the low output voltage of the pressure sensors, we will need a high-precision S&H circuit. The ADC will sample one channel at a time, so the S&H circuit must have a fast enough acquisition time to settle within the accuracy limits before the ADC conversion starts.

Considering these constraints, we can outline the following specifications for the S&H block:

1. **Acquisition Time**: To accurately capture the signal at 400 Hz, we must ensure that the S&H circuit's acquisition time is significantly lower than the sampling period. A standard design principle is to have an acquisition time that is at least ten times faster than the sampling interval. With a 400 Hz signal, the sampling interval is 2.5 ms (1/400 Hz). Therefore, an acquisition time of less than 250 microseconds would be appropriate.

2. **Aperture Time**: Aperture time is the interval during which the S&H circuit is open to accept the signal. It should be as small as possible to minimize error due to signal variation during this time. A typical aperture time could be in the range of nanoseconds to a few microseconds.

3. **Hold Mode Settling Time**: After the hold command is given, the S&H circuit should settle to within the specified accuracy quickly. A settling time of less than 1 microsecond is desirable to ensure the output voltage does not drift significantly from the sampled value during the hold phase.

4. **Hold Mode Droop Rate**: The voltage decay during the hold phase should be minimal to maintain accuracy. A droop rate of less than 1 µV/ms is typical for precision applications.

5. **Topologies**:
   - **Discrete Component Design**: A discrete design using a high-precision operational amplifier, a MOSFET as a switch, and a low leakage hold capacitor. This design allows for customization and optimization based on available components but requires careful layout to minimize noise and leakage.

   - **Monolithic Sample & Hold IC**: A dedicated S&H IC such as the LF398 or AD783 provides a compact and reliable solution with integrated components designed for optimal performance. These ICs typically offer low droop rates, fast acquisition times, and good thermal stability.

Given the lack of detailed specifications, a monolithic S&H IC is suggested due to its ease of use, reliability, and the likelihood that it will meet the required performance specifications out of the box. For instance, the LF398 S&H IC provides an acquisition time of 6 µs to 0.01% accuracy, which is well within the desired range, and a very low droop rate.

**Materials and Values**:
- **Sample & Hold IC**: LF398 or equivalent
- **Hold Capacitor (Chold)**: 0.01 µF to 0.1 µF, polypropylene or Teflon dielectric for low leakage.
- **Bypass Capacitors**: 0.1 µF ceramic capacitors for power supply filtering
- **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)**: FR4 material with a ground plane for noise immunity and thermal stability

The values selected here are based on typical application notes for the LF398 and similar S&H ICs. Adjustments might be necessary based on the final ADC characteristics and system performance requirements.

INFRARED DETECTOR SELECTION

Given the lack of specific information, I will suggest a type of infrared detector suitable for general surface temperature monitoring, keeping in mind the requirement for a non-linear scale and a maximum output of 100 mV.

**TYPE OF SENSOR**: For this application, a non-contact infrared thermopile sensor is appropriate. These sensors are capable of measuring temperature from a distance by detecting the infrared radiation emitted by the object. A thermopile sensor converts thermal energy into an electrical signal.

**SUGGESTED MODEL**: The Heimann Sensor HTM1735 is a good candidate. It is a compact, sensitive, and reliable thermopile sensor that provides a digital output corresponding to the detected temperature.

**TEMPERATURE RANGE**: Most infrared thermopile sensors have a broad temperature detection range. The HTM1735, for instance, can measure temperatures from -20°C to +1000°C, which should cover the requirements of most machine surfaces.

**VOLTAGE AND CURRENT**: The sensor typically operates at 3.3V or 5V, which is a common voltage for many electronic devices. The current draw is usually low, in the microampere range, making it energy-efficient for continuous monitoring.

**RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY**: The resolution of the HTM1735 is less than 0.02°C (20 mK) at room temperature, and it has a sensitivity that allows for 1% accuracy in temperature measurements, which aligns with the project requirements.

**SIGNAL LINEARIZATION**: Given the non-linear output of infrared sensors, a logarithmic amplifier or digital processing (if applicable) may be necessary to linearize the temperature readings. This detail is critical for achieving the required accuracy and should be incorporated into the signal conditioning stage.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS**: Infrared sensors like the HTM1735 are robust and can operate in various environmental conditions. However, if there are extreme environmental factors, additional housing or protective measures may be necessary.

**RESPONSE TIME AND SPECTRAL RESPONSE**: The HTM1735 has a fast response time and a spectral response in the 8 to 14 µm range, which is typical for thermopile sensors and suitable for detecting surface temperatures.

Given this information, the aforementioned sensor can be integrated into the system design with appropriate signal conditioning to ensure that it meets the project's requirements. Proper shielding and grounding considerations should also be taken into account to minimize electrical noise and interference.

LOGARITHMIC AMPLIFIER BLOCK

For the logarithmic amplifier block, the goal is to linearize the non-linear output voltage of the infrared radiation detectors that corresponds to the temperature measurements. Given the lack of specific details on the characteristics of the infrared detectors, we will make reasonable assumptions to proceed with the design.

Assumptions and Design Criteria:
1. Temperature Range: Assuming a typical industrial range for surface temperature monitoring, the range might be from 0°C to 500°C.
2. Output Voltage Range: Since the maximum output of the radiation detectors is 100 mV, we can normalize this to represent the upper limit of the temperature range. The lower limit is less clear, but we might assume a minimum measurable voltage of 1 mV for practical purposes.
3. Nonlinearity Characteristics: Without specific data, we might assume a logarithmic or exponential response characteristic, common for infrared detectors, where the voltage output is proportional to the logarithm of the incident radiation power, which in turn is related to the temperature.
4. Response Time and Bandwidth: A typical response time for an industrial process monitoring application might be in the order of milliseconds. A bandwidth of at least twice the highest frequency of interest (400 Hz) would be suitable, so a bandwidth of at least 800 Hz to 1 kHz would be reasonable.
5. Noise and Stability: Low noise operational amplifiers (op-amps) should be chosen for the logarithmic amplifier to minimize the introduction of measurement errors and to maintain stability over the operating temperature range.
6. Supply Voltage and Power Constraints: Common supply voltages for industrial instrumentation are ±15 V or ±12 V. Power consumption is typically not a major constraint in such systems, but efficiency is always desirable.

With these assumptions:

Topology Suggestion:
- A logarithmic amplifier using an operational amplifier with a diode or transistor in the feedback loop can be used to create the logarithmic relationship between the input and output voltages.

Numeric Gain Values:
- The gain of the logarithmic amplifier is not constant across its input range, as it is dependent on the diode or transistor characteristics. Instead of a fixed gain, the amplifier will provide an output voltage Vout = K * log(Vin/Vref) where K is a scale factor, Vin is the detector output voltage, and Vref is the reference voltage.
- K should be chosen so that the ADC can resolve the smallest temperature change of interest. If the ADC has, for example, a 12-bit resolution with a reference voltage of 5V, the smallest change it can detect is approximately 1.22 mV. To ensure that the full temperature range uses the full ADC range, the output should span from 0V to 5V over the temperature range.

Component Suggestions:
- The specific logarithmic amplifier IC, such as the AD8307 from Analog Devices, can be used as the logarithmic amplifier since it provides a precise logarithmic amplification over a wide dynamic range.
- Alternatively, discrete components such as an op-amp with a matched diode pair (for temperature compensation) in the feedback loop can be used for custom applications.

Since no more information is available, the above suggestions are to be further refined by the user with data from specific sensors and system requirements.

LOW_PASS_FILTER_TEMPERATURE

Given the lack of specific requirements, we will proceed with reasonable assumptions for the temperature sensor filtering block. The key objective is to allow signals up to 400 Hz to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies to prevent aliasing during the analog-to-digital conversion process.

Topology:
The topology selected is an Active Low-Pass Filter using an operational amplifier (op-amp). This choice is due to its capability to provide amplification if needed, stable operation, and ease of implementation.

Filter Type:
A second-order Sallen-Key Butterworth filter topology is chosen for its flat passband characteristic, which will not distort the amplitude of the signal within the passband.

Cutoff Frequency (f_c):
The cutoff frequency will be chosen slightly higher than the highest frequency of interest (400 Hz) to ensure minimal signal attenuation within the passband. A reasonable choice is 450 Hz.

Roll-off Rate:
A second-order filter provides a roll-off rate of -12 dB/octave, which should suffice for this application. If stronger attenuation is required beyond the cutoff, a higher-order filter can be used.

Component Selection:
- Op-amp: Any low-noise, general-purpose op-amp that can operate in the desired frequency range can be used, such as the TL072 or LM358.
- Resistors (R1, R2) and Capacitors (C1, C2): The values for these components will be chosen based on the standard formula for a Sallen-Key Butterworth filter to achieve the desired 450 Hz cutoff frequency. For equal values of resistors and capacitors, the cutoff frequency (f_c) is given by f_c = 1 / (2 * π * R * C). Assuming R = 10 kΩ, the C value would be approximately 35 nF.

Damping Factor (ζ):
For a Butterworth filter, the damping factor is 1 / √2, which corresponds to a maximally flat passband response.

The range to be filtered out is anything above 450 Hz, ensuring that the ADC does not sample unwanted high-frequency noise or interference.

In summary, the key characteristics of the Low-Pass Filter for the temperature channel are:
- Type: Second-order Sallen-Key Butterworth active filter
- Cutoff Frequency (f_c): 450 Hz
- Roll-off Rate: -12 dB/octave
- Filter Components: R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ, C1 = C2 = 35 nF
- Op-amp: General-purpose (e.g., TL072, LM358)

Bear in mind that the actual component values might need fine-tuning based on the specific characteristics of the temperature sensor signals and the rest of the signal chain components.

ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC)

Given the project requirements and the lack of additional information, the best approach to implement the ADC block is to make educated assumptions based on typical industry standards and the provided specifications.

Type of ADC:
- Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC is recommended for this application due to its balance between speed, resolution, and cost. SAR ADCs are capable of meeting the medium-to-high resolution requirements while still providing a fast enough sampling rate for the 400 Hz signal frequency.

Resolution:
- To achieve the 1% accuracy for both pressure and temperature sensors, a resolution that can discern a change in 1% of the full-scale signal is necessary. Assuming a full-scale output of 100 mV from the temperature sensors (the higher of the two sensor outputs), a 1% change is 1 mV. The ADC should thus have a resolution finer than 1 mV. Given that ADC resolution is expressed in bits, we calculate it as follows:
  - An ADC with a full-scale range of 100 mV and 10-bit resolution has a least significant bit (LSB) of approximately 0.1 mV. This would be sufficient to resolve 1% changes in the temperature sensor. However, to accommodate any signal conditioning and provide headroom for noise, a 12-bit resolution (LSB ~ 0.025 mV) is recommended.

Sampling Rate:
- According to the Nyquist theorem, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal being sampled. With a signal frequency of 400 Hz, a minimum sampling rate of 800 samples per second (SPS) is required to avoid aliasing. However, to ensure adequate resolution in the frequency domain and account for any signal conditioning latency, a higher sampling rate of at least 2 kSPS is recommended.

Accuracy:
- The ADC's integral and differential nonlinearity (INL and DNL) should be within ±1 LSB to maintain overall system accuracy. Additional accuracy can be achieved through careful PCB layout, signal conditioning, and calibration procedures.

Speed:
- Speed is not critical beyond the need to sample each channel at 2 kSPS. Given the successive nature of the SAR ADC and the presence of 16 channels (8 pressure + 8 temperature), the ADC should be capable of a total throughput rate of at least 32 kSPS to sample all channels sequentially within the 1-second interval.

Signal Conditioning:
- The system will likely require signal conditioning before the ADC to amplify the sensor outputs (1 mV for pressure and 100 mV for temperature) to match the full-scale input range of the ADC, thereby maximizing resolution. Additionally, anti-aliasing filters should be implemented to eliminate frequencies above 400 Hz.

Power Consumption, Size, and Cost Constraints:
- Low-power, small-footprint SAR ADCs are widely available and suitable for this application. The specific choice will depend on the budgetary constraints of the project.

Digital Interface Protocol:
- The choice of digital interface protocol depends on the requirements for data transfer speed and the capabilities of the computer that will be analyzing the data. A Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is commonly used for its speed and simplicity.

Based on these considerations, the ADC block should be a 12-bit SAR ADC, with at least 2 kSPS sampling rate per channel, ±1 LSB INL and DNL, SPI interface, suitable signal conditioning, and appropriate anti-aliasing filters.

Strain-Gauge Sensor

Given the lack of specific information about the pressure range, operating conditions, and other characteristics, we will make reasonable assumptions to define the strain-gauge sensor block.

Assumptions for Pressure Range and Sensitivity:
- The pressure range for industrial machinery is typically from 0 to 10 MPa (0 to 100 bar). Thus, we'll design our strain-gauge sensor to cover this range.
- Sensitivity should be such that the maximum pressure (10 MPa) corresponds to the maximum output of 1 mV. With a 1 mV/V excitation, this implies a sensitivity of 0.1 μV/Pa.

Sensor Type and Model Suggestion:
- We suggest using a full-bridge configuration strain-gauge to maximize sensitivity and temperature compensation. A possible model could be the Honeywell Sensotec Model TJE, which offers high accuracy, a wide pressure range, and compatibility with industrial environments.

Operating Range and Environmental Conditions:
- Temperature range: We'll assume a standard industrial temperature range of -40°C to 85°C.
- The sensor must be robust and ideally have an IP rating that reflects its ability to withstand dust, water, and other environmental factors. For industrial machinery, an IP65 rating or higher is desirable.

Resolution and Accuracy:
- With a 1% accuracy requirement for the measurement, and assuming the full scale is 10 MPa, the maximum error allowed is 0.1 MPa.
- The resolution should be finer than the accuracy requirement to ensure reliable performance. We'll aim for a resolution of 0.01 MPa.

Sensitivity:
- Sensitivity is defined as the output voltage change per unit of pressure change. With the parameters mentioned above, the sensitivity would be around 0.1 μV/Pa. For ease of signal conditioning, we will use an amplifier to increase this to a more manageable voltage level.

Signal Conditioning Requirements:
- An instrumentation amplifier is necessary to amplify the mV signal from the strain-gauge to a level that can be digitized effectively by the ADC.
- Temperature compensation is crucial for accurate readings over the sensor's operating temperature range. This may be built into the sensor or provided by additional circuitry.
- A stable excitation voltage for the strain-gauge is important. A regulated power supply should be used to ensure consistent sensor performance.

In conclusion, the Strain-Gauge Sensor block will consist of a full-bridge strain-gauge with a sensitivity of around 0.1 μV/Pa, designed to measure pressures up to 10 MPa. It will be coupled with an instrumentation amplifier to boost the signal, and temperature compensation will be included to ensure accuracy over the entire operating temperature range. The sensor will be chosen with a robust design suitable for industrial environments.

Analog Instrumentation System for Pressure and Temperature Monitoring

Pressure Measurement Subsystem:
- Strain-Gauge Sensor: Full-bridge strain-gauge, Honeywell Sensotec Model TJE or similar, with a pressure range of 0 to 10 MPa and sensitivity of 0.1 μV/Pa.
- Instrumentation Amplifier: Three-op-amp configuration (e.g., AD620 or INA118) with a gain of 5000 to amplify the 1 mV signal from the strain-gauge to a suitable level for the ADC. The gain can be set using precision resistors and a potentiometer for calibration.
- Low Pass Filter: Second-order Sallen-Key Butterworth filter designed to have a cutoff frequency of 350 Hz to eliminate frequencies above 400 Hz. Calculated component values for R = 10 kΩ and C = 4.7 nF.
- Sample & Hold Circuit: Using a monolithic Sample & Hold IC such as the LF398, with a hold capacitor value of 0.01 μF to 0.1 μF, polypropylene or Teflon for low leakage.

Temperature Measurement Subsystem:
- Infrared Detector: Non-contact infrared thermopile sensor, e.g., Heimann Sensor HTM1735, capable of measuring temperatures from -20°C to +1000°C.
- Logarithmic Amplifier: AD8307 or similar, with a scale factor K chosen so that the full temperature range corresponds to the ADC input range (e.g., 0V to 5V).
- Low Pass Filter: Similar second-order Sallen-Key Butterworth active filter as in the pressure subsystem, with component values designed for a cutoff frequency just above the signal frequency of interest (e.g., 450 Hz).
- Sample & Hold Circuit: Similar configuration as in the pressure subsystem, ensuring fast acquisition and low droop rate during the hold phase.

Analog Multiplexer:
- 16-Channel Analog Multiplexer: CD74HC4067 or equivalent, capable of handling the voltage levels from both the pressure and temperature sensor conditioning circuits with fast enough switching to sample each channel sequentially at the desired ADC rate.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
- 12-bit SAR ADC, capable of at least 32 kSPS total throughput to sample all 16 channels within a 1-second interval. Selected for its resolution finer than 1 mV (least significant bit) to resolve 1% changes in sensor outputs. Low-power, small-footprint, and SPI interface for communication with the computer.

Output to Computer:
- Interface: USB 3.0 or Ethernet for data transfer to computer.
- Data Format and Protocol: Raw binary or ASCII encoding, with a packet structure to indicate data type (pressure or temperature) and sensor index.

General Design Considerations:
- All electronic components selected should be suitable for the industrial temperature range of -40°C to 85°C.
- The system should incorporate proper shielding and grounding to minimize electrical noise and interference.
- Power supply voltages for the analog circuitry are assumed to be ±15 V, with consideration for low power consumption and efficient operation.
- The PCB material should be FR4 with a ground plane for noise immunity and thermal stability
