1. The output should be measured by a multimeter
2. There should be amplification stage and the gain must be provided and justified
3. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ÂºC .
4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor and the value is provided and justified.
5. The architecture should be roughly consisting of the sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering and measurement. Or some variation not too far off of this.
6. The sensor used is an NTC
7. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is between 0 and 20 Volts
8. The self heating effect is taken into account and there is something in the solution that controls it.
