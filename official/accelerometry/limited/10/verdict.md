Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project presents a comprehensive design for a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device utilizing a piezoelectric accelerometer and a charge amplifier among other components. However, some discrepancies arise when cross-referencing the provided specifications with the given requirements:

1. Feedback resistance (R_f) times feedback capacitance (C_f) is 62 MΩ * 10 pF = 620 μs, which is significantly higher than the required 2/pi (approximately 0.637 μs), and it is well outside of the allowed 10% difference. This does not meet the essential requirement.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (V_out_peak / Q_in_peak) is 0.5 V / 0.51 pC = 980.39 V/pC. Multiplying the gain by 1.61E-12 and dividing by the feedback capacitance (C_f) yields (980.39 V/pC * 1.61E-12) / 10E-12 = 0.157, which is far from the target value of roughly 1 and beyond the allowed 10% difference. This requirement is also not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly stated, but if we assume the peak charge (Q_in_peak) from the accelerometer is 0.51 pC for a single event, then for peak-to-peak (assuming symmetrical behavior), it would be 1.02 pC, which is significantly lower than the required 161 pC. The requirement is not met.

4. Bias current is not provided nor specified in the design. The requirement is not met.

5. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (R_f) is 0.01 / 62 MΩ = 161.29 pA. The bias current should be equal to this value according to the requirement, but since the bias current is not provided, this cannot be verified.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which aligns with the requirements.

7. The design is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, which is in line with the requirement. However, there is no explicit mention of calculations backing up the optimization for 5 cm amplitude.

8. The output voltage is specified as 0.5 V peak with a gain calculation based on this value, not the required 1 V peak to peak. This requirement is not met.

9. There is mention of offset correction with a potentiometer, but no specific value is given to verify whether the offset is kept below 10 mV. This requirement is not adequately addressed.

Given these points, the project fails to meet several essential requirements, specifically 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. The design is theoretically correct in some areas, but contains elements that make it impossible to implement as described due to the discrepancies with the stated requirements.
