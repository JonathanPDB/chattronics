Design of an Analog Instrumentation System for Pressure and Temperature Monitoring

Pressure Sensor Array:
- Model: Honeywell 26PC Series
- Pressure Range: 0 to 500 psi
- Output: 1 mV/V at full scale, sensitivity around 2 mV/V/psi
- Accuracy: ±1% Full Scale Span
- Temperature Range: -40°C to +85°C
- Supply Voltage: 10 VDC to 30 VDC

Instrumentation Amplifier Array for Pressure Sensors:
- Gain Requirement: Assuming a 5V ADC input range and a maximum sensor output of 1 mV, a gain of 5000 is needed.
- Suggested Amplifier Topology: Two-stage amplification with a precision instrumentation amplifier (such as INA118 for the first stage) followed by a precision op-amp (like the OP07 for the second stage).

Temperature Sensor Array:
- Model: MLX90614
- Temperature Range: -70°C to +380°C
- Output: Digital (PWM or SMBus/I2C compatible)
- Accuracy: ±0.5°C around room temperatures
- Resolution: 0.02°C
- Field of View (FOV): 90°
- Supply Voltage: 3.3V or 5V
- Current Consumption: < 1.5 mA

Non-Linearity Correction for Temperature Sensors:
- Correction Approach: Microcontroller-based lookup table with a precision DAC to linearize the output of the infrared temperature sensors.
- Microcontroller: STM32 series with integrated ADC and DAC.
- DAC Resolution: At least 10-bit, matching or exceeding the ADC resolution.

Amplifier Array for Temperature Sensors:
- Gain Requirement: Assuming a 5V ADC input range and a maximum sensor output of 100 mV, a gain of 50 is needed.
- Suggested Amplifier Topology: Non-inverting amplifier using a precision operational amplifier (such as AD8237) to achieve the required gain.

Low-Pass Filter Array for Pressure and Temperature Signals:
- Filter Type: Butterworth for its maximally flat frequency response in the passband.
- Cutoff Frequency: Set to 500 Hz for pressure and 450 Hz for temperature signals to attenuate unnecessary frequencies above 400 Hz.
- Filter Order: 2nd order (two-pole) providing a roll-off rate of 12 dB/octave.
- Component Values: R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ, C1 = C2 ≈ 31.8 nF (use 32 nF as a standard value).

Multiplexer:
- Model: CD74HC4067 16-channel CMOS analog multiplexer/demultiplexer.
- Switching Speed: >10 kHz to ensure negligible time is spent switching compared to the sampling interval.
- On-Resistance: Low (<100 Ohms) to prevent voltage drop across the multiplexer.
- Additional Features: Pull-down resistors on control inputs for known state on power-up, decoupling capacitors near power supply pins.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
- Type: Successive approximation register (SAR) ADC.
- Resolution: 12-bit or higher for better accuracy.
- Sampling Rate: 2 kHz per channel to capture the maximum signal frequency of 400 Hz.
- Input Range: Adjustable or with PGAs to accommodate the conditioned sensor signals.
- Input Impedance: High, typically in the megaohms range.
- Interface: SPI for medium-speed applications.

Data Interface:
- Interface Protocol: USB 2.0 or Ethernet, depending on distance and system requirements.
- Throughput: USB 2.0 supports 480 Mbps, which is adequate for the data rate of approx. 153.6 kbps.
- Additional Features: CRC or checksum for data integrity, potential data encryption for sensitive data, and basic pre-processing capabilities if the system allows.
