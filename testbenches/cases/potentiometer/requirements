1. The potentiometer is inserted into a voltage divider
2. The architecture is simple: there is a voltage divider, an anti-aliasing filter and then the DAQ measures the voltage.
3. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered in 0, for example, +/- 7V.
4. There is a safety net that stops the output voltage from surpassing the maximum value of +/- 7V. This is absolutely required.
5. The is an anti-aliasing filter
6. The cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter is specified to be around 10 and 30 Hz.
7. The order of the anti-aliasing filter is specified to be 3 or 4.
