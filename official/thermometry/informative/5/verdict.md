Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project proposal includes a Vishay NTCLE100E3 series NTC thermistor for temperature sensing and outlines a system architecture that encompasses sensor linearization, signal conditioning, filtering, and amplification for a 0 to 20 Volts output range. The system design addresses the need for linearization at the midpoint temperature of 50°C by proposing a parallel resistor calculated using the Beta parameter equation, which is a standard approach for thermistor linearization. An operational amplifier is suggested for amplification, and the gain is calculated to ensure the output voltage range is suitable for the ADC and multimeter measurement. The anti-aliasing filter design and ADC selection are appropriate for the application. Importantly, the proposal includes calibration to ensure accuracy.

However, there are areas where the proposal does not fully meet the requirements or needs further clarification:
1. The project omits explicit mention of the self-heating effect on the NTC and the maximum current passing through it. This is a critical aspect since self-heating can significantly affect measurement accuracy.
2. The actual resistance value of the linearization resistor (R_L) at 50°C is not provided; it is only stated that it needs to be calculated or obtained from the datasheet.
3. The proposal does not include specific details on how the gain of the output voltage amplifier was justified, other than mapping the 0 to 1 Volt signal to a 0 to 20 Volts range.

While the project includes most elements of the required architecture and seems theoretically sound, the lack of detail regarding self-heating and the justification for the amplifier gain, as well as the exact linearization resistor value, means the proposal is not fully optimal. It can be considered acceptable if these issues are addressed in further detail.
