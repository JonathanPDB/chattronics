Analog Temperature Measurement System Design

The project consists of designing an analog temperature measurement system that uses an NTC thermistor (Vishay NTCLE100E3) to measure the temperature of water within a beaker, providing a voltage output that can be read by a standard multimeter.

1. **NTC Thermistor (Sensor Block):**
   - Sensor Model: NTC Vishay NTCLE100E3
   - Temperature Range: 10 to 90 degrees Celsius. The typical resistance at 25 degrees Celsius is specified in the sensor datasheet, and the resistance at the midpoint (50 degrees Celsius) can be estimated using the sensor's B-value.

2. **Linearization Resistor:**
   - A parallel resistor is used to linearize the thermistor response. A typical B-value around 3950 K and an initial resistance (R25) of 10k ohms lead to an estimated resistance at 50 degrees Celsius (R50) of approximately 6.23k ohms. Therefore, a 6.2k ohm precision resistor is suggested for linearization.

3. **Buffer Amplifier:**
   - Topology: Non-Inverting Op-Amp Buffer
   - Op-Amp Model: General-purpose CMOS operational amplifier, such as the MCP6002
   - Power Supply: Assuming 5V supply voltage
   - Input Impedance: > 10 MΩ
   - Gain: Unity (1), achieved by connecting the negative input (inverting) and output of the op-amp together.

4. **Gain Stage:**
   - Topology: Non-Inverting Amplifier or Instrumentation Amplifier
   - Gain Calculation: Assuming the output voltage needs to swing from 0V to 20V, the required gain is determined by the voltage change across the thermistor due to temperature changes. If the thermistor's voltage change is 0.1V, then Gain = 20V / 0.1V = 200. Resistors for the chosen op-amp would be selected accordingly, based on the exact value of the thermistor voltage range.

5. **Low-Pass Filter:**
   - Topology: Second-order Sallen-Key Butterworth filter
   - Component Values: Assuming a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz, R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ, C1 = C2 = 1.59 µF
   - Damping Factor: 1/√2, for a maximally flat frequency response in the passband.

6. **Output Stage:**
   - Voltage Range: 0 to 20 Volts for the multimeter
   - Protection: Basic protection elements, like a series resistor (e.g., 100 ohm) and clamp diodes (e.g., 1N4148) for overvoltage conditions.
   - Calibration: Include a precision potentiometer for adjustable calibration.
   - Connector: BNC or banana plug connector compatible with the multimeter probes.

7. **Voltage Output:**
   - The final voltage output of the system will be between 0 to 20 Volts, corresponding to the measured temperature range. The output voltage should be measured using a multimeter set to the correct voltage range (if not auto-ranging) or directly interfaced to an analog-to-digital converter for digital display.

Instructions for Setting Up and Using the System:
- Ensure all components are connected according to the design.
- Power on the system and allow it to stabilize.
- Place the NTC thermistor in the water within the beaker.
- Connect the output voltage to the multimeter using appropriate probes/connectors.
- Calibrate the system using the potentiometer to match the voltage output to the known temperature.
- Take readings from the multimeter and interpret the temperature based on the voltage output.
