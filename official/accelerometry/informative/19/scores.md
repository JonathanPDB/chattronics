Score: 3
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) are given as approximately 3.125 MÎ© and 10 nF respectively. However, Rf * Cf = 3.125e6 * 10e-9 = 0.03125 s, which is not close to 2/pi (approximately 0.6366), hence requirement 1 is not met.

2. The charge amplifier gain (G) is not explicitly given. However, we know that the desired output voltage is 1 Vpp for an input charge of 1.6 pC, which suggests a gain of 0.5 V / 1.6 pC = 312.5 MV/C. Multiplying this gain by 1.61E-12 and dividing by the feedback capacitance gives (312.5E6 * 1.61E-12 / 10E-9) = 0.0502, which is not close to 1, so requirement 2 is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated as 1.6 pC, which is not around 161 pC, so requirement 3 is not met.

4. The bias current is not specified, so requirement 4 is not met.

5. The calculation for the bias current using 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (Rf) is not provided, so requirement 5 is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which meets requirement 6.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and has calculations to back it up, which meets requirement 7.

8. The output voltage is specified as 1 V peak to peak, which meets requirement 8.

9. Information about the offset is not provided, so requirement 9 is not met.

Overall, the project summary covers requirements 6, 7, and 8.
