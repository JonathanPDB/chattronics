Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project description generally aligns with the given requirements, but there are a few discrepancies to note:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, as required.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V, which is in line with the specifications.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, buffering, and anti-aliasing filter before the DAQ, meeting the simplicity requirement.
4. An attenuator is implemented to scale the -10V to +10V signal to the DAQ's Â±7V range, ensuring the input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0. However, the use of Zener diodes rated for 7.5V for voltage clamping may allow voltages slightly above 7V, potentially violating the maximum voltage requirement for the DAQ.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ should be 7V. The use of 7.5V Zener diodes introduces a risk of overvoltage, which could be fatal as per the requirements.
6. An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency of 150 Hz is included, which should help avoid aliasing.
7. A low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz is designed to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, satisfying this requirement.
8. The filter's cutoff frequency and order are not explicitly stated to ensure a -20 dB gain at 500 Hz, which is a requirement. However, given the second-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz, it is highly probable that the gain at 500 Hz would be at least -20 dB.

The primary concern is the potential overvoltage to the DAQ due to the Zener diodes' voltage rating. This could be fatal to the DAQ system if not properly accounted for. The rest of the design seems to meet the project's requirements, but this potential overvoltage issue needs to be addressed.
