Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The Pendulum Angle Measurement System Design Summary shows a well-thought-out system that includes a potentiometer for angle measurement, a buffer, a level shifter, a notch filter, an amplifier, and an anti-aliasing filter. The design seems to fulfill most of the requirements set forth, with some concerns to be addressed:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, fulfilling requirement 1.
2. The power supply range for op-amps is mentioned to be a minimum of +/-10V, which could imply that the voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the +/- 10 V range, fulfilling requirement 2.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider (potentiometer), a buffer (voltage follower), a level shifter, a notch filter, an amplifier, and an anti-aliasing filter. This meets requirement 3, although the inclusion of a level shifter and amplifier goes beyond the simple architecture described.
4. The level shifter is designed to adjust the output range to -7V/+7V, which would center the input voltage of the DAQ in 0, as required in requirement 4.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is designed to be 7V, fulfilling requirement 5.
6. There is an anti-aliasing Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz, which should prevent aliasing, meeting requirement 6.
7. A notch filter with a center frequency of 55 Hz is designed to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, satisfying requirement 7.
8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz and is of second order, but the attenuation at 500 Hz is specified as -40 dB, which is better than the -20 dB required, fulfilling requirement 8.

The main concern is that the summary does not explicitly state that the maximum voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the +/- 10 V range. However, it is implied by the power supply range for the op-amps. Additionally, the inclusion of a level shifter and amplifier adds complexity to the architecture, which might not align with the simplicity requirement.

Overall, the project seems to meet the necessary requirements, but with some assumptions and additional complexity that was not specified as needed.
