Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water in a Beaker

Architecture Overview:
The system is designed to measure the temperature of water in a beaker using an NTC thermistor and output a voltage easily measurable by a multimeter. The architecture encompasses the following blocks: Thermistor, Linearizing Resistor, Wheatstone Bridge, Instrumentation Amplifier, Low-Pass Filter, Voltage-to-Voltage Converter, and Output Voltage.

Thermistor:
- Sensor: NTCLE100E3103GB0 (Part of Vishay NTCLE100E3 series, 10kΩ at 25°C, ±2% tolerance, suitable for 10-90°C range).

Linearizing Resistor:
- Value: 10kΩ precision resistor (0.1% tolerance, assumption for calculation).
- The resistor is chosen to linearize the response of the NTC around the 50°C midpoint of the temperature range. Exact values to be determined after consulting the thermistor's datasheet.

Wheatstone Bridge:
- Resistors: 10kΩ precision resistors (0.1% tolerance, 25 ppm/°C) for stability and accuracy.
- Excitation Voltage: Assuming a regulated 10V supply for optimal range and sensitivity.
- The bridge balances the thermistor and linearizing resistor to generate a differential voltage representing the temperature.

Instrumentation Amplifier:
- Gain: Two-stage approach with initial gain of 100 followed by a gain of 2, assuming a 5V max input from the Wheatstone bridge.
- Op-amp: Precision amplifiers like AD620 for the first stage with high CMRR (≥80 dB) and low offset voltage (<1mV).
- Power Supply: ±15V assumed for optimal dynamic range.
- The amplifier conditions the bridge output to fit the 0-20V output range for the multimeter.

Low-Pass Filter:
- Topology: Sallen-Key, 2nd order active filter.
- Cutoff Frequency: 1 Hz (to filter high-frequency noise).
- Components: R1 = R2 = 10kΩ, C1 = C2 = 15.9nF (for a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz).
- Op-amp: OPA2134 (low noise, high precision).
- Provides signal smoothing to ensure a clean output for measurement.

Voltage-to-Voltage Converter:
- Configuration: Non-inverting amplifier using an op-amp with adjustable gain.
- Op-amp: LM324 or similar, with supply voltage of ±15V.
- Gain: Adjustable, with feedback resistor (Rf) of 75kΩ, input resistor (Ri) of 10kΩ, and a 10kΩ multi-turn potentiometer for fine-tuning.
- Protection: Output diodes like 1N4148 to prevent over-voltage to the multimeter.

Output Voltage (0-20V):
- Measurement Equipment: High-precision digital multimeter with 0.1% accuracy.
- Calibration: Fine-tuning the voltage-to-voltage converter gain until the output voltage represents the temperature measured by a calibrated reference thermometer.
- Safety: Incorporate isolation techniques if interfacing with potentially hazardous systems.

Overall, this system provides a robust method for measuring water temperature with an analog approach that culminates in an easily readable voltage for a multimeter while taking into consideration self-heating, accuracy, and the practicality of the design.
