Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary presents a comprehensive design for an analog temperature measurement system using an NTC thermistor. It includes the sensor, linearization, buffering, amplification, level shifting, scaling, and filtering stages, which aligns with the required architecture.

The linearization of the NTC thermistor is addressed with the use of a linearization resistor (Rp), and the value is calculated to match the resistance of the NTC at 50°C, which meets the requirement for linearization optimized for the midrange temperature of 50°C.

An amplification stage is included with an adjustable gain between 7 to 10, which is provided and justified to match the desired output voltage range of 0 to 20 Volts. This gain ensures that the signal from the NTC thermistor can be amplified to a level suitable for measurement by a multimeter.

The design also takes into account the self-heating effect by keeping the operating current of the NTC thermistor under 100 µA. This shows that the maximum current passing through the NTC is known, fulfilling the requirement to consider the self-heating effect.

The output is intended to be measured by a multimeter, with calibration steps provided to ensure the output voltage range matches the temperature accurately.

However, the design does not specify exactly how the linearization is validated to be 'absolutely necessary' or how the linearity across the full temperature range is ensured. Without evidence of the linearization effectiveness across the entire range, we cannot confirm this requirement is fully met.
