Score: 4
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) product equals 27 MΩ * 22 pF = 594 pFΩ which is not close to the required 2/pi ≈ 0.637 pFΩ. This does not meet the requirement.
2. The project specifies a gain (Av) of approximately 510 kV/C. Using the formula G x 1.61p / Cf, we get (510 kV/C * 1.61E-12) / 22E-12 = 37.41 which is not close to 1, failing this requirement.
3. The charge output mentioned in the project is 1.96 pC peak, which differs from the required 161 pC peak. This does not meet the requirement.
4. The bias current is not explicitly mentioned, so this requirement is not met based on the provided information.
5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance equals the bias current cannot be evaluated due to the lack of information about the bias current.
6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, so this requirement is met.
7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, and the calculations are provided, meeting this requirement.
8. The full-scale output voltage is given as 1 V peak to peak, which meets the requirement.
9. The offset voltage is specified to be kept below 10 mV, meeting the requirement.

Out of the 9 listed requirements, the project summary successfully covers requirements 6, 7, 8, and 9. Requirements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are either not met or there is not enough information to determine compliance.
