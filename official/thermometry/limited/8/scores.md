Score: 7
Explanations: 
The project summary provides an overview of an analog water temperature measurement system design using an NTC thermistor. The requirements are evaluated as follows:

1. The output is measured by a multimeter: The summary specifies a multimeter with specific capabilities for measurement, meeting this requirement.
2. Amplification stage with gain provided and justified: A gain stage is described with a non-inverting op-amp configuration, a 1kΩ input resistor, and a 19kΩ feedback resistor to achieve a gain of 20. This is justified as mapping a 0-1V input to a 0-20V output, meeting this requirement.
3. The output voltage range is between 0 and 20 Volts: The summary describes a level shifter and an output buffer to ensure the voltage remains within the 0-20V range, meeting this requirement.
4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC: A parallel resistor value of 4966 ohms is chosen to match the thermistor resistance at 50 ºC for improved linearity, meeting this requirement.
5. The NTC is linearized: The summary indicates the use of a parallel resistor and a Wheatstone bridge for linearization, meeting this requirement.
6. The architecture consists of the sensor, linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering, and measurement: The summary describes a system with these stages, meeting this requirement.
7. The sensor used is an NTC: The sensor is explicitly stated as a Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor, meeting this requirement.
8. The self-heating effect is taken into account: The summary mentions that the circuit is designed to minimize self-heating of the thermistor below 1%, but it does not provide the maximum current that passes through the NTC, partially meeting this requirement. The requirement is not fully met as there is no explicit maximum current value given.

Overall, the project summary meets 7 out of the 8 requirements, with the 8th requirement only partially met due to the lack of specific maximum current value through the NTC. However, since the requirement explicitly asks for the maximum current and it is not provided, this cannot be considered as met.
