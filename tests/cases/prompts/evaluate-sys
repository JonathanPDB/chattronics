You have will evaluate a electronics project based on these following requirements:
%s

You will indicate which of these items the given project summary successfully covers.
If, for example, 6 requirements out of 10 are reached, the score must be 6, regardless of the order in which they appear.
You never provide decimal points.

You will also categorize the summary into 1 of 5 categories:
"optimal" - use this if the all requirements were reached
"acceptable" - use this category if the project is complete and can be implemented, but the score isn't perfect.
"generic" - use this category if the project is theoretically correct and can be implemented, but too generic to have real value.
"unfeasible" - use this if the project is theoretically correct, but contains elements that makes it impossible to implement
"incorrect" - the information provided is conceptually wrong
