Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary describes an analog system for measuring the angle of a pendulum using a potentiometer and a DAQ system. The requirements for the project are as follows:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider – The summary indicates the use of a rotary wirewound precision potentiometer, which is consistent with the voltage divider application.

2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V – The op-amp selection for the buffer (LM358 or TL071) suggests that the potentiometer is powered by the same -10 V to +10 V source, fulfilling this requirement.

3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, an anti-aliasing filter, and the DAQ measures the voltage – The summary describes a voltage divider, scaling amplifier, buffer amp, band-stop filter, and an anti-aliasing filter before the DAQ, which aligns with the requirement.

4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, +/- 7V – The scaling amplifier is designed to adjust the potentiometer's output range to fit the DAQ's input range.

5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V – The scaling amplifier is configured to ensure that the output does not exceed +/- 7V.

6. There is a low pass filter (anti-aliasing filter) – A second-order active Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 250 Hz is included, which serves as an anti-aliasing filter.

7. There is a filter removing frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz – A Twin-T Notch Filter combined with an Active Band-Reject Filter is used to attenuate these frequencies.

8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz – The anti-aliasing filter is second-order, which gives a roll-off rate of -40 dB/decade. A cutoff frequency of 250 Hz will result in a gain of less than -20 dB at 500 Hz, satisfying this requirement.

However, there are a couple of concerns that need to be addressed:

- The scaling amplifier configuration details provided (R1 = 10kΩ, R2 = 4kΩ) do not match the requirement to scale the potentiometer's output range from -5V to +5V up to the DAQ's -7V to +7V input range. The gain of 1.4 would be correct if the original voltage range were -5V to +5V, but the potentiometer's specified 0V at the steady position (90 degrees) and the system's full-scale range are inconsistent with the requirement for a centered voltage at the DAQ. This could potentially lead to incorrect scaling and an output that does not match the DAQ's input specifications.

- The summary does not mention whether the offset adjustment is not required because the system inherently centers at 0V, or if it has been omitted. If the potentiometer does not inherently output 0V at the steady position, then an offset adjustment would be necessary to ensure the voltage is centered at 0V for the DAQ.

Given the above concerns, particularly the potential issue with the voltage scaling not matching the required input range for the DAQ, the project would be placed in the "acceptable" category. The project can be implemented, and it meets most requirements, but there are inconsistencies that need clarification or potential adjustment to ensure the maximum voltage and centering at the DAQ input are as specified.
