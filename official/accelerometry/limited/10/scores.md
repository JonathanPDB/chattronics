Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) product is Rf * Cf = 62 MΩ * 10 pF = 620 μs. The requirement is that Rf * Cf ≈ 2/π (≈ 0.637 μs), so the design does not meet this requirement as the value is significantly larger.

2. The charge amplifier gain (V_out_peak / Q_in_peak) is 0.5 V / 0.51 pC = 0.98 V/pC. Using the formula G x 1.61p / Cf, we get (0.98 V/pC * 1.61E-12)/10E-12 = 0.1568, which is not roughly around 1, so this requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is specified as 0.51 pC from the accelerometer, which is not the 161 pC required, so this requirement is not met.

4. The bias current must be provided, but there is no explicit mention of the bias current being provided in the summary, so this requirement is not met.

5. The requirement that 0.01 / Rf equals the bias current is not met because there is no information about the bias current being equal to 0.01 / 62 MΩ.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as stated in the summary.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, as specified by the frequency response of the accelerometer and the low-frequency cutoff of the charge amplifier, and calculations are provided for other design choices, but not specifically for 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude.

8. The output voltage is specified to be 0.5 V peak on the charge amplifier, which is not the 1 V peak-to-peak required, so this requirement is not met.

9. There is no explicit mention of the offset voltage, but offset correction is mentioned, implying an attempt to keep the offset below 10 mV. However, without numeric evidence, this requirement cannot be confirmed as met.
