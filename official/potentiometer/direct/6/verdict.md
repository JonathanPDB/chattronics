Verdict: incorrect

Explanations: 
The project summary presents a comprehensive design for an analog electronics system to measure pendulum angles. The main components include a linear potentiometer, a voltage follower (buffer), a gain stage, notch filters for 50 Hz and 60 Hz, an anti-aliasing filter, and a DAQ system. Let's analyze the requirements:

1. The potentiometer is appropriately used as a voltage divider, fulfilling the first requirement.

2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the specified +/- 10 V range.

3. The architecture is straightforward, with a voltage divider, buffer, gain stage, filters, and a DAQ, matching the simplicity requirement.

4. The gain stage is designed to scale the potentiometer's output to the DAQ's input range of +/- 7V. However, the gain is set at 1.4 with resistor values provided, which is a mismatch. The actual gain calculation for a non-inverting amplifier is (1 + R1/R2), which in this case is (1 + 40k/100k) = 1.4, not scaling the maximum voltage of +/- 10V down to +/- 7V, as required.

5. The DAQ system is designed to match an input voltage range of +/-7V, which is a critical requirement. However, due to the incorrect gain calculation, the maximum voltage may exceed 7V, which is a fatal flaw.

6. The anti-aliasing filter is a 2nd-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 450 Hz, which should prevent aliasing effectively.

7. The design includes notch filters to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, fulfilling this requirement.

8. The anti-aliasing filter's cutoff frequency and order are not explicitly stated to achieve the required -20 dB at 500 Hz. Further calculation or testing would be needed to confirm this.

Overall, while the design is well thought out and addresses most requirements, the gain calculation error poses a risk of applying voltages higher than +/- 7V to the DAQ, which is a fatal flaw. The anti-aliasing filter's performance at 500 Hz is also not confirmed.
