Thermistor: A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance varies significantly (more than in standard resistors) with temperature. It will be immersed in the beaker to measure the temperature of the water.\n\n2. Linearization Circuit: The function of this block is to linearize the non-linear thermistor response, which means to convert the exponential relationship between the thermistor resistance and temperature into a linear one. This can be achieved by implementing, for instance, a resistance-to-voltage conversion circuit with an operational amplifier, where the voltage output is a linear function of the temperature.\n\n3. Voltage Amplifier: The linearized signal might be too weak to be measured directly by the multimeter. The amplifier increases the signal voltage to a level that can be accurately read by the multimeter.\n\n4. Multimeter: The multimeter will be used to measure the voltage from the amplifier which corresponds to the temperature of the water.\n```",
