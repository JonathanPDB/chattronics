    "response": "```explanations\n1. The feedback resistance (Rf) is 8 MΩ and the feedback capacitance (Cf) is 200 pF. The product Rf*Cf is 8e6 * 200e-12 = 1.6e-3, which is roughly 0.509 (since 1/(2*pi) is approximately 0.159). This does not meet the requirement of being roughly around 2/pi (allowing up to 10% difference).\n\n2. The charge amplifier gain is not provided directly, but the peak charge output is given as 100 pC at 1 g acceleration, and the corresponding peak voltage is 0.5 V. However, we cannot determine if the gain multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by Cf is roughly around 1 without the explicit gain value.\n\n3. The peak-to-peak charge output is mentioned as 100 pC at 1 g acceleration. This does not meet the requirement of being around 161 pC.\n\n4. The bias current is not provided explicitly in the summary.\n\n5. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (Rf) gives 0.01 / 8e6 = 1.25e-9 A, which is the bias current according to the requirement. However, since the bias current is not explicitly provided, we cannot confirm this requirement.\n\n6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor.\n\n7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of up to 2 Hz, which is mentioned in the context of the low-frequency cutoff of the amplifier. The calculations backing this up are not provided, but the design intent is clear.\n\n8. The output voltage is not explicitly stated to be 1 V peak to peak.\n\n9. The offset voltage is not mentioned; therefore, we cannot confirm if it is kept below 10 mV.\n\nFrom the provided summary, it is clear that the project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor and is optimized for an input oscillation of up to 2 Hz. However, the other requirements are either not met or cannot be confirmed with the provided information.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n2\n```",
