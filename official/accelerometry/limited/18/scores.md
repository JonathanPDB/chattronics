Score: 5
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and feedback capacitance (C_f) are given as 68 MΩ and 10 pF, respectively. This gives an R_fC_f product of 68 MΩ * 10 pF = 680 µs, which is not close to 2/π (≈ 0.637) with a 10% tolerance. This requirement is not met.

2. The charge amplifier gain (G) of 6.16 * 10^6 V/C and the feedback capacitance (C_f) of 10 pF is used to check the second requirement. Multiplying the gain by 1.61E-12 and dividing by the feedback capacitance gives (6.16 * 10^6 V/C) * (1.61E-12 C/pC) / (10 pF) = 0.98, which is within the 10% tolerance of 1. This requirement is met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is stated as 162.28 pC, which is very close to the required 161 pC. This requirement is met.

4. The bias current is mentioned to be balanced with a series resistor in the feedback loop, but the actual value is not provided. This requirement is not explicitly met.

5. The feedback resistance (R_f) is given, but there is no mention of the bias current being 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance. This requirement is not explicitly met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the signal from a piezoelectric sensor. This requirement is met.

7. The project includes a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz, which is optimized for the input oscillation of 2 Hz, but there is no explicit mention of calculations backing up the 5 cm amplitude. This requirement is not fully met.

8. The output voltage is designed to be 1 V peak to peak. This requirement is met.

9. An ultra-low bias current op-amp is used to minimize offset voltage, and the ADC input range is adjusted for the 10 mV offset, suggesting that the offset is kept below 10 mV. This requirement is met.

Overall, the project summary covers 5 out of the 9 requirements, as requirements 1, 4, 5, and 7 are not fully met based on the information provided.
