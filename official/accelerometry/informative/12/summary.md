Design for a Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

SENSOR BLOCK - Piezoelectric Accelerometer
- Sensor Type: General-purpose IEPE piezoelectric accelerometer with built-in preamplifier and a sensitivity of 100 pC/g.
- Maximum acceleration (a_max) calculated from peak displacement (5 cm) at 2 Hz frequency is approximately 0.4 g.
- Operating Temperature Range: Assumed to be -40°C to +85°C for industrial applications.
- Power Supply Requirements: 2 to 20 mA at 18 to 30 VDC for IEPE sensors.

CHARGE AMPLIFIER BLOCK
- Amplifier Gain (G): Approximately 125 V/nC to convert the maximum expected charge (40 pC) into a 5 V peak output voltage.
- Op-Amp Selection: Low offset voltage op-amp to maintain an offset less than 10 mV.
- Power Supply: Assumed to be ±15 V for the op-amp, providing suitable headroom.

LOW-PASS FILTER BLOCK
- Filter Type: 2nd-order Butterworth active filter for a maximally flat passband.
- Cutoff Frequency: 10 Hz to allow a buffer above the 2 Hz signal frequency.
- Component Values: Assuming a dual ±15 V supply for the active filter,
  - Resistors (R1, R2): 15.9kΩ.
  - Capacitors (C1, C2): 100 nF.

ADC BLOCK
- Sampling Rate: 100 samples per second (100 S/s), well above the Nyquist rate.
- Resolution: 16 bits to cater to a high dynamic range.
- Input Voltage Range: ±10V to match the expected output from the charge amplifier.
- ADC Topology: Sigma-Delta (Σ-Δ) for high-resolution and inherent noise filtering.
- Interface: SPI for its higher speed, suitable for real-time applications.
- SNR: >90 dB and low THD for high-fidelity signal capture.

MICROCONTROLLER/DSP BLOCK
- Processing Capabilities: To handle data acquisition, signal conditioning, and basic vibration analysis.
- Power Efficiency: Low-power modes for conserving power, optimized firmware for power management.
- Environmental Robustness: Industrial-grade components for broad temperature and humidity operation.
- Development Tools: Options may include C/C++, DSP libraries, and potentially an RTOS for task management.

Calculations:
1. Maximum acceleration (a_max) from peak displacement (d) at frequency (f):
   a_max = (2 * π * f)^2 * d
   a_max = (2 * π * 2)^2 * 0.05 m
   a_max ≈ 0.4 g

2. Output charge (Q_max) from the sensor:
   Q_max = Sensitivity * a_max
   Q_max = 100 pC/g * 0.4 g
   Q_max = 40 pC

3. Charge Amplifier Gain (G):
   G = V_out / Q_in
   G = 5 V / 40 pC
   G = 125 V/nC

4. Low-pass Filter Component Values:
   Cutoff frequency (fc): 10 Hz
   R = 15.9kΩ (standard value)
   C = 1 / (2 * π * R * fc)
   C ≈ 100 nF

Note that the above calculations and component value selections are based on typical industry standards and assumptions made due to the lack of specific user requirements. These may need to be adjusted based on the actual sensor model, environmental conditions, and detailed application requirements.
