Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and capacitance (Cf) are not explicitly given in terms of their product Rf*Cf. Without a specific value for Rf, we cannot confirm whether Rf*Cf is approximately 2/pi with up to a 10% difference. The chosen Rf of 10 MÎ© and Cf of 3.18 nF would yield 31.8 microseconds, which is not close to the required 2/pi (approximately 0.637 microseconds) value.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not provided explicitly, making it impossible to evaluate whether the condition G x 1.61p / Cf is roughly around 1 with up to a 10% difference.

3. The project summary states that the peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be 10 pC, which does not meet the requirement of approximately 161 pC.

4. The bias current is not mentioned in the project summary, so we cannot confirm if it is provided or not.

5. The project summary does not provide the value of the bias current, so we cannot confirm if 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance equals the bias current.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, fulfilling this requirement.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, which is explicitly stated, but there is no mention of calculations backing up an amplitude of 5 cm, so we cannot fully confirm this requirement.

8. The desired output voltage is stated to be 1 V peak-to-peak, meeting this requirement.

9. The offset is not discussed in the project summary, so we cannot confirm if it is kept below 10 mV.
