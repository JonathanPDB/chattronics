Water Temperature Measurement System Using NTC Thermistor

The proposed system measures the temperature of water within a range of 10 to 90 degrees Celsius using a Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor and outputs a voltage ranging from 0 to 20 Volts for measurement by a multimeter. The system is purely analog and utilizes several signal conditioning blocks to produce an accurate and linear voltage output correlated to the temperature.

1. Sensor Block (NTC Thermistor)
   - Component: Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor
   - Characteristics: Typically 10kΩ resistance at 25°C, beta value approximately 3500K (assumed for calculations)

2. Buffer Amplifier
   - Configuration: Non-inverting operational amplifier
   - Purpose: Provides impedance isolation
   - Components: Precision op-amp such as AD8628 or OPA2333, precision resistors for gain setting

3. Linearization Network
   - Method: Voltage divider with a fixed resistor in series with the NTC thermistor
   - Fixed Resistor (R_FIXED): 10kΩ (chosen based on a typical midpoint resistance value for the temperature range)

4. Gain Stage
   - Configuration: Non-inverting operational amplifier
   - Gain Calculation: Assuming a 1-2V output from the voltage divider, a gain of 10 to 20 is needed to achieve the 0 to 20V output range
   - Components: An op-amp like the TL081, precision resistors for setting gain (e.g., 1kΩ and 10kΩ potentiometer for adjustable gain)

5. Level Shifter
   - Configuration: Op-Amp Adder Circuit
   - Operational Amplifier: LM324 or equivalent capable of rail-to-rail output
   - Power Supply: Assumed ±15V supply voltage for ample output swing

6. Output Buffer
   - Configuration: Voltage follower (unity gain buffer)
   - Operational Amplifier: Rail-to-rail op-amp like OPAx177 or AD8605
   - Gain: 1 (unity gain)

7. Anti-Aliasing Filter (Noise Suppression)
   - Configuration: Second-order (two-pole) Butterworth low-pass filter
   - Cutoff Frequency: 1 Hz
   - Components: General-purpose op-amp like LM358 or TL072, resistors 10kΩ, capacitors 15µF or 16µF (nearest standard value)
   - Calculation: \[ fc = \frac{1}{2\pi RC} \] with R = 10kΩ, C ≈ 15.92 µF

The aforementioned blocks and configurations serve to process the signal from the thermistor to provide a linear and accurate voltage output representing the temperature of the water. Calibration and empirical adjustments may be required to account for the specific behavior of the NTC thermistor in the application environment. The final design should be prototyped and tested to refine component values and ensure overall system accuracy and stability.
