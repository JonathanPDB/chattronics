        "content": "Pendulum Angle Measurement System Design\n\nHigh-Level Architecture Overview\nThe system is designed for measuring the angle of a pendulum using a potentiometer and consists of several blocks: Input Conditioning, Signal Processing, Output Conditioning, and Data Acquisition. Each block is critical in translating the mechanical angle into a digital signal.\n\nInput Conditioning\n- Component: Potentiometer (Bourns 3590S series or Vishay Spectrol Model 534)\n  - Type: Precision rotary, 10kΩ resistance, wirewound or conductive plastic\n  - Operating Temperature: -55°C to +125°C\n  - Power Rating: 0.5W to 1W\n\n- Component: Buffer Amplifier\n  - Op-Amp: AD8605 or OPA333 for low offset voltage and drift, Rail-to-Rail output\n  - Configuration: Voltage Follower\n  - Power Supply: ±15V if dual supply; single supply if required with virtual ground\n\nSignal Processing\n- Component: Scaling Amplifier\n  - Op-Amp: LM358 (Low power, general-purpose, wide bandwidth)\n  - Gain: \\( A = \\frac{DAQ_{max} - DAQ_{min}}{Pot_{max} - Pot_{min}} = \\frac{14V}{10V} = 1.4 \\)\n  - Resistors: \\( R_f = 4kΩ \\) (or nearest standard value), \\( R_g = 10kΩ \\)\n\n- Component: Notch Filter (50 \u0026 60 Hz)\n  - Topology: Multiple Feedback Notch Filter\n  - Quality Factor (Q): 10\n  - Attenuation Depth: At least 20 dB at the notch frequencies\n  - Resistors: \\( R1 = R2 = 31.8kΩ \\) (closest 1% standard value)\n  - Capacitors: \\( C1 = C2 = 10nF \\) (closest 1% standard value)\n\nOutput Conditioning\n- Component: Offset Adjust\n  - Configuration: Summing Amplifier using an operational amplifier\n  - Offset Voltage: Adjustable during calibration via a trim potentiometer\n\n- Component: Anti-aliasing Filter\n  - Type: 4th-order Butterworth active filter\n  - Cutoff Frequency: 400 Hz\n  - Op-Amps: TL074 or OP07\n\nData Acquisition (DAQ) Block\n- ADC Resolution: At least 12 bits for precision angle measurement\n- Sampling Rate: Matching DAQ rate of 1000 samples per second\n- Input Range: ±7V to match the DAQ input range\n\nThe entire system is designed to be adjusted and calibrated to ensure accurate conversion of the pendulum's angular position to a digital signal suitable for the DAQ system. The potentiometer is mechanically linked to the pendulum to measure the angle, and the output is conditioned through buffering, scaling, and filtering to fit the DAQ's input range. Noise at 50 and 60 Hz is attenuated using notch filters. The system also includes an anti-aliasing filter to prevent sampling artifacts, and the DAQ converts the conditioned analog signal into digital format at a high resolution to ensure precision."

    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary covers the following requirements:\n\n1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider: The description mentions the use of a potentiometer for measuring the angle of a pendulum. It is implied that the potentiometer is part of the input conditioning and thus would act as a voltage divider in this context.\n\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V: This is not explicitly mentioned, but given the power supply for the buffer amplifier is ±15V, it is reasonable to assume that the potentiometer could be supplied with +/- 10 V. However, without explicit confirmation, this requirement is not met.\n\n3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, an anti-aliasing filter, and then the DAQ measures the voltage: The system does have a voltage divider (potentiometer), an anti-aliasing filter (4th-order Butterworth active filter), and a DAQ block.\n\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, +/- 7V: The DAQ input range is stated as ±7V, which implies it is centered at 0.\n\n5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V: The DAQ input range is specified as ±7V, which meets this requirement.\n\n6. There is a low pass filter (anti-aliasing filter) that avoids aliasing: A 4th-order Butterworth active filter with a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz is mentioned, which serves as the anti-aliasing filter.\n\n7. There is a filter removing frequencies between around 50 and 60 Hz: A notch filter with an attenuation depth of at least 20 dB at the notch frequencies (50 \u0026 60 Hz) is included in the design.\n\n8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz: The anti-aliasing filter is a 4th-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz. A 4th-order Butterworth filter has a slope of 24 dB/octave beyond the cutoff frequency. Since 500 Hz is close to the cutoff frequency, the attenuation at 500 Hz would not be -20 dB. Therefore, this requirement is not met.\n\nIn summary, the requirements 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are met based on the provided project summary. Requirements 2 and 8 are not met. Therefore, the score is 6.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n6\n```",
