Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device Design

SENSOR SELECTION
A piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g is suggested for vibration measurement. Suitable models include the Dytran series 2006V or PCB Piezotronics 351B series. These have the necessary low-frequency response with a 3 dB point at 0.25 Hz to capture the target frequency range up to 2 Hz.

CHARGE AMPLIFIER DESIGN
The charge amplifier is designed to convert the piezoelectric sensor's charge output into a voltage output with the following parameters:
- Feedback Capacitor (Cf) = 1 nF
- Feedback Resistor (Rf) ≈ 620 kΩ (standard value close to the calculated 636619.772 kΩ)
- Amplifier Gain (A) = 10^7 V/C
These values ensure a 3 dB point at 0.25 Hz and a 1 Vpp output voltage.

LOW-PASS FILTER DESIGN
An active second-order Butterworth low-pass filter is selected with a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz to allow the frequency range of interest to pass with minimal attenuation:
- Operational Amplifier: low-noise, FET input op-amp
- Resistors (R1, R2): 10 kΩ
- Capacitors (C1, C2): 8.2 nF (chosen for a standard value near the calculated 7.96 nF)

BUFFER STAGE DESIGN
A voltage follower configuration is selected for the buffer to provide high input impedance and low output impedance:
- Operational Amplifier: precision op-amp with low offset voltage and bias current such as the AD8628 or OPA333
- Unity Gain Configuration: direct connection from output to negative input
- Capacitive Decoupling: 0.1 µF and 10 µF near the power supply pins

ADC SELECTION
The ADC must digitize the conditioned analog signal with the following minimum specifications:
- Resolution: 16-bit
- Input Voltage Range: ±5V or ±10V
- Sampling Rate: 100 Hz
- THD: < -90 dB
- SNR: > 90 dB
- Interface: SPI for high-speed data transfer

DSP IMPLEMENTATION
The DSP block should be capable of performing tasks such as noise reduction, signal averaging, FFT, and feature extraction. Without specific constraints, standard communication protocols and efficient power usage are recommended.

Overall, the designed system is based on educated assumptions due to lack of specific user requirements. The proposed design provides a robust framework for a low-frequency vibration measurement device and can be adjusted as more detailed specifications are provided.
