Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project design for the "Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device" has been evaluated based on the provided criteria. Below is the assessment of whether the project meets the given requirements:

1. The feedback resistance and capacitance product for the charge amplifier is given as R_f = 620 kOhms and C_f = 1 nF. The product R_f * C_f = 620e3 * 1e-9 = 0.62 ms, which does not meet the requirement of being roughly around 2/pi (approximately 0.637 ms), but with a difference of less than 10%, it is within the acceptable range.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is stated to be G = 10^7 V/C. Using the formula G x 1.61E-12 / C_f, we get 10^7 * 1.61E-12 / 1E-9 = 16.1, which is significantly higher than the requirement of being roughly around 1. This is a major discrepancy and does not meet the requirement.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly stated, but the accelerometer sensitivity and the expected peak acceleration suggest that the charge output could be in the correct range. However, without specific calculations, this cannot be confirmed.

4. The bias current is not provided, nor is there a calculation or mention of it in the project summary.

5. The relationship between 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance and the bias current is not addressed in the summary.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the signal from the piezoelectric sensor, which is in line with the requirements.

7. The charge amplifier is optimized for a low-frequency cutoff at 0.25 Hz, which is suitable for the intended 2 Hz input oscillation, and calculations are provided to back this up.

8. The desired output voltage is 1 V peak-to-peak, which aligns with the given requirement.

9. The offset voltage is not mentioned in the summary, so it is unclear whether it is below the required 10 mV.

Given the discrepancies, particularly with the charge amplifier gain relative to the feedback capacitance and the lack of information on the bias current and offset voltage, the project does not meet all the essential requirements and therefore cannot be considered optimal. However, it does include several correctly addressed elements, such as the use of a charge amplifier and the optimization for low-frequency input signals.
