Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water Beaker

The proposed project architecture entails several analog signal conditioning stages to measure temperature with a thermistor and output a voltage range of 0-20V. Below is a summary of each block, detailing the components, values, and considerations.

Input Signal Block:
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor, nominal resistance of 10kΩ at 25°C, beta value of 3950K to 3977K.
- Operating current to minimize self-heating: Below 0.5mA.
- Expected resolution: 0.1°C corresponding to a voltage resolution of 0.11V.
- Response time: Less than 5 seconds for temperature changes.

Linearization Block:
- Linearization resistor (R_lin) chosen to match thermistor resistance at 50°C midpoint.
- R_lin calculation: R_T50 = R25 * exp[B * (1/T50 - 1/T25)], where R25 = 10kΩ, B ≈ 3977K, T50 = 323.15 K, T25 = 298.15 K.
- R_lin standard value close to calculated R_T50.

Buffer Block:
- Op-amp configuration: Voltage follower.
- Selected op-amp: Rail-to-rail input/output type, such as OPAx2336 or OPAx197.
- Power supply: Assumed ±15V for dual supply, or +24V for single supply with mid-supply virtual ground.
- Input impedance: >1MΩ, Output impedance: <100Ω.

Gain Stage Block:
- Non-inverting amplifier configuration.
- Op-amp: LM324 or equivalent with low offset voltage, low drift, and wide supply voltage range.
- Gain calculation: Av = Vout_max / Vin_max = 20V / 1V = 20.
- Feedback resistors: Rin = 10kΩ, Rf ≈ 180kΩ (for Av ≈ 19) or adjustable to achieve exact gain.
- Bandwidth: Selected to be sufficient for temperature changes, typically a few Hz.
- Power supply: Assumed +/-15V for dual supply or +24V for single supply with virtual ground.

Level Shifter Block:
- Summing amplifier configuration with reference voltage.
- Components: Precision resistors (R1, Rf, Rg), op-amp (similar to buffer block).
- R1 value: Adjusted to ensure 0V output corresponds to 10°C.
- Example R1 calculation: R1 = (Vref * Rg) / Vlow, assuming Vref = 5V and gain stage output at 10°C is Vlow = 1V, then R1 = (5V * 20kΩ) / 1V = 100kΩ.

Anti-Aliasing Filter Block:
- Low-pass Butterworth filter configuration.
- Filter order: 2nd order.
- Cutoff frequency: 10 Hz to eliminate high-frequency noise.
- Components: Precision resistors and capacitors with low temperature coefficients.

Output Voltage Block:
- Measurement: High-impedance digital multimeter (DMM) with a voltage range of up to 20V and at least 0.1% accuracy.
- Calibration: Performed using a precision voltage reference.
- Connection: Shielded cables to minimize noise pickup.

Throughout the system, care is taken to minimize thermal drift, noise, and power consumption while ensuring accuracy and linearity of the temperature-to-voltage conversion. Precision components with low temperature coefficients are selected, and stability is ensured through appropriate feedback and compensation. The values and configurations provided are based on typical specifications and standards and should be verified against actual component datasheets and environmental conditions for final implementation.
