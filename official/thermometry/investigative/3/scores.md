Score: 7
Explanations: 
The project summary covers the following requirements:

1. The output is being measured by a multimeter: The summary explicitly states that a digital multimeter with auto-ranging capability is used to measure the output voltage range of 0-20V.

2. Amplification stage with gain provided and justified: The project describes using an instrumentation amplifier with a gain of 200, which is justified by the need to scale the maximum expected input voltage of 100mV to an output of 20V.

3. Output voltage range between 0 and 20 Volts: The project aims to achieve an output voltage range of 0-20V, which aligns with the requirement.

4. NTC linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ÂºC: The summary indicates that the NTC thermistor is linearized at 50 degrees Celsius using a calculated parallel resistor, although the exact calculation is omitted.

5. NTC linearization: The summary reaffirms the importance of linearization and indicates that it is part of the design, even though the exact calculation is not provided.

6. Architecture: The project summary follows the required architecture, including the sensor (NTC thermistor), linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering (low-pass filter), and measurement.

7. Sensor used is an NTC thermistor: The project specifies the use of a Vishay NTCLE100E3 series NTC thermistor.

8. Self-heating effect is taken into account: Although the summary does not explicitly state the maximum current passing through the NTC, it mentions the consideration of waterproofing and environmental protection, which implies that self-heating might have been considered. However, without specific information on the maximum current, this requirement is not fully met.

The project does not provide details on the exact beta value, precise resistance-temperature relationship, or power supply voltages, which are necessary for a complete assessment of the design. Additionally, the maximum current through the NTC is not specified. Therefore, the score is based on the requirements that are clearly met.
