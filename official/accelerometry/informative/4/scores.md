Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) are given as 1.59 MΩ and 1 nF, respectively. The product Rf * Cf = 1.59 MΩ * 1 nF = 1.59 ms. This value should be roughly around 2/pi ms which is approximately 0.637 ms. The actual product, however, is significantly higher than 2/pi (more than 10% difference), so this requirement is not met.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not explicitly provided in the project summary. However, the gain (G) can be calculated as the ratio of the output voltage to the input charge (G = Vout/Qin). Since the peak-to-peak output voltage is 1 V and the peak-to-peak charge output is 161 pC (requirement 3, which is mentioned as the typical charge output from the piezoelectric sensor), we have G = 1 V / 161 pC = 6.21×10^9 V/C. The term G x 1.61p / Cf = (6.21×10^9 V/C) x (1.61×10^-12 C) / (1×10^-9 F) ≈ 1, which is roughly around 1 (allowing up to 10% difference). This requirement is met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not directly mentioned in the summary, but the sensor can handle a maximum charge output of 500 pC, which is consistent with a typical output of 161 pC. This requirement is implicitly met.

4. The bias current is not provided in the summary, so this requirement is not met.

5. The relationship between the feedback resistance and the bias current is stated (0.01 / Rf = bias current), but since the bias current is not provided, this requirement is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is explicitly mentioned. This requirement is met.

7. The project is optimized for a low-frequency response with a cutoff frequency (fc) of 0.1 Hz, which would be suitable for an input oscillation of 2 Hz. However, there is no explicit information about the calculations for the 5 cm amplitude. This requirement is not fully met due to the lack of specific calculations for the amplitude.

8. The output voltage of 1 V peak-to-peak is explicitly mentioned in the ADC block. This requirement is met.

9. There is no mention of the offset voltage or how it is kept below 10 mV, hence this requirement is not met.
