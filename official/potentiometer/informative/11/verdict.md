Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System mostly adheres to the provided requirements, with some areas that require clarification or adjustment:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, which aligns with the requirements.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V, which meets the specified input voltage range for the potentiometer.
3. The architecture is simple and includes the required elements: a voltage divider (with a voltage buffer), an anti-aliasing filter, and a DAQ system.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, with a range of +/- 7V, which matches the requirement.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V, ensuring that the DAQ is not exposed to voltages above its maximum rating.
6. The low-pass filter design with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz will serve as an anti-aliasing filter, which is necessary to prevent aliasing.
7. The notch filter design is intended to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which is a requirement for the project.
8. However, the requirement for the filter to have a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz is not directly addressed in the provided summary. The low-pass filter with a cutoff at 50 Hz might meet this requirement, but this is not explicitly stated.

The design assumes ideal op-amps and does not consider non-ideal characteristics that could affect the performance of the buffer amplification stage and the filters. Additionally, the power supply voltage levels for the notch filter's operational amplifiers should be higher than +/- 10 Volts to ensure proper operation and headroom, which may be a concern given the available power supply voltage.

While the proposed design is theoretically sound, it lacks specific information about the actual implementation and testing of the filters to ensure that they meet the gain requirement at 500 Hz. Additionally, the power supply requirements for the notch filter operational amplifiers may need to be reassessed to ensure compatibility with the available voltages.

Overall, the design can be implemented, but it may require further refinement to fully comply with all the requirements, particularly the filter performance at 500 Hz and the power supply considerations for the notch filters.
