Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary describes an analog temperature measurement system using an NTC thermistor, which includes a linearization stage with a fixed resistor optimized for 50°C, an amplification stage, and optional filtering. The use of a high-value fixed resistor to limit current through the NTC thermistor addresses the self-heating effect. The output voltage range is designed to be within 0-20 Volts, suitable for measurement by a multimeter.

However, the summary does not specify the actual gain value or the justification for choosing it, which is a requirement for the project. It only mentions that the gain is adjustable using a potentiometer, which suggests that the gain can be set, but does not confirm that the chosen gain ensures the output voltage range is between 0 and 20 Volts. Additionally, while the use of a potentiometer for gain adjustment is mentioned, there is no explicit description of how the gain is calculated or justified based on the sensor's output range.

Moreover, the summary does not provide explicit evidence that the NTC is linearized, as it only mentions the use of a precision resistor to match the thermistor's resistance at the midpoint temperature of 50°C for optimal sensitivity. Linearization implies that the resistance-temperature characteristic of the NTC thermistor is made linear over a certain range, but the summary does not explicitly state that this has been achieved or describe the methodology used to ensure it.

Lastly, the maximum current that passes through the NTC is mentioned to be known and minimized by choosing a high-value fixed resistor, but the actual value of the current is not provided, which is necessary to evaluate if the self-heating effect is truly taken into account adequately.

Based on the information provided, the requirements for gain provision and justification, explicit evidence of NTC linearization, and the disclosure of the maximum current through the NTC are not fully met. Therefore, the project summary is missing critical details required to ensure that all requirements are reached.
