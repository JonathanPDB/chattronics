Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project design for a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device using a piezoelectric sensor and a charge amplifier contains several details that need to be assessed against the requirements provided:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) of 10 MΩ and feedback capacitance (Cf) of 64 nF gives a product of Rf*Cf = 10^7 Ω * 64*10^-9 F = 0.64 s. This product should be roughly around 2/π s (approximately 0.637 s). The calculated product is within the 10% difference allowed, so this requirement is met.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier (G) is specified as 10^7 V/C. Using the formula G * 1.61E-12 / Cf, we get (10^7 V/C * 1.61E-12 C) / 64E-9 F = 2.515625, which is not roughly around 1 and exceeds the allowed 10% difference. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly mentioned in the design summary provided, but assuming the sensitivity of the sensor and the gain of the charge amplifier, it seems plausible that the design could achieve the target of around 161 pC. However, without explicit confirmation, this requirement cannot be verified as met.

4. The bias current is not provided in the design summary, which is an essential requirement. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

5. There is no mention of 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance equating to the bias current, so this requirement is not met.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which meets this requirement.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, but there are no explicit calculations provided to back this up. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

8. The output voltage is stated to be 1 V peak-to-peak, which meets this requirement.

9. The offset voltage is not mentioned, and therefore it is unclear whether it is kept below 10 mV. This requirement cannot be verified as met.

Given these findings, the project does not meet several essential requirements, particularly the correct gain calculation for the charge amplifier, provision of bias current, the relationship between the bias current and feedback resistance, and evidence of optimization calculations. Therefore, the project cannot be considered as "optimal" or "acceptable".
