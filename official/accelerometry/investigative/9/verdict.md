Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project's design description indicates a well-thought-out approach to measuring low-frequency vibrations with a piezoelectric sensor, but there are discrepancies when comparing the details to the provided requirements.

1. The feedback resistor (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) values are not provided explicitly, hence it's not clear if Rf*Cf is around 2/pi with a 10% tolerance. Without these values, it's not possible to verify if this requirement is met.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not specified, nor is the calculation G x 1.61p / Cf provided to check if it is roughly around 1 within a 10% tolerance.

3. The expected charge output is mentioned as 10 pC peak to peak, which is significantly lower than the required 161 pC peak to peak. This indicates that either the sensor sensitivity or the input amplitude is not sufficient to meet the target charge output.

4. Bias current provision is mentioned, but there is no explicit statement or calculation showing the bias current or how it is derived from the feedback resistance. Therefore, it's not possible to verify if 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance equals the bias current.

5. The project is indeed optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, as the cutoff frequency of the charge amplifier and the low-pass filter are designed around this frequency.

6. The output voltage of 1 V peak to peak is in line with the requirements.

7. Offset voltage is not addressed, so it's unclear if the design keeps the offset below the required 10 mV.

While the device design seems theoretically valid for the intended application, it falls short of several specific requirements provided. Therefore, the project cannot be categorized as "optimal" or "acceptable". The design is not "incorrect" as the concepts used are valid for analog electronics design. However, it is also not "generic" as it does target a specific application and frequency range. It appears that the project could potentially be implemented but lacks important details and does not fully meet the provided specifications. As such, the best categorization, given the information, would be "unfeasible" since the project, in its current state, contains elements that make it impossible to implement as per the given requirements.
