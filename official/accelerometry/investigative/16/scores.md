Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (Rf) and feedback capacitance (Cf) are given as 25.3 MΩ and 25 pF, respectively. The product Rf x Cf = 25.3 MΩ * 25 pF = 632.5 s. This does not meet the requirement of being roughly around 2/pi (approximately 0.637 s), even with a 10% tolerance.

2. The charge amplifier gain (Aq) is 40,000 V/Coulomb. With Cf = 25 pF and using the formula Aq x 1.61E-12 / Cf, we get 40,000 x 1.61E-12 / 25E-12 = 2.576. This is not roughly around 1, even with a 10% tolerance.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not mentioned in the summary, but it is implied that the accelerometer can produce a maximum charge of 100 pC at 1g. However, there is no information on the peak-to-peak charge output for the specific input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude.

4. The bias current is not provided explicitly in the summary.

5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current is not met, as the feedback resistance is provided (25.3 MΩ), but the bias current is not mentioned.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the signal from the piezoelectric sensor, which meets this requirement.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz, which is mentioned in the summary, but there are no calculations provided to back up this optimization.

8. The output voltage is mentioned to be 4V peak with a gain of 40,000 V/Coulomb for the charge amplifier. This does not correspond to the required 1 V peak-to-peak output voltage.

9. There is no mention of the offset voltage or its value, so we cannot confirm if it is kept below 10 mV.

The only requirement clearly met is number 6.
