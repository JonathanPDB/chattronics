I want to develop a project that calculates the angle of a pendulum by using a potentiometer.
The component will be fixed to a wooden structure and another beam will be connected to the adjustable pin.
The output must be viewed using LabVIEW and, therefore, will be measured using a DAQ.
The DAQ configurations are fixed and cant be changed.

The potentiometer is linear
The value of the potentiometer is 10 kOhms
The input voltage range should be between -10 and 10 Volts
The angle range that the potentiometer should be able to measure is from 0 to 180 degrees
The structure should be able to measure at least 20 evenly spaced out angles
The sampling rate of the DAQ is 1000 samples per second
Frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz should be already damped
The maximum accepted input voltage for the DAQ is +/- 7 V
