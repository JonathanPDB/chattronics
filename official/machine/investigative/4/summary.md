- Bandwidth: At least a few MHz.
- On-Resistance: Low.
- Crosstalk and Off Isolation: Minimal and High, respectively.
- Protection Features: Overvoltage and ESD protection.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
- Resolution: Minimum 16-bit for fine granularity.
- Sampling Rate: Total rate > 10 ksps to handle eight channels at 800 Hz each.
- Topology: Successive approximation register (SAR).
