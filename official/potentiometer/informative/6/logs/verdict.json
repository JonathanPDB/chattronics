    "response": "```explanations\nThe project design for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System mostly meets the requirements, but there are a few points of concern:\n\n1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, as required.\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V, which is within the specified range.\n3. The architecture is simple and includes a voltage buffer, an anti-aliasing filter, and measurements by the DAQ.\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, with a range of +/- 7V as specified.\n5. The gain stage calculation ensures that the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is within the 7V range, though it is not explicitly mentioned if there are safeguards to prevent exceeding this voltage.\n6. The anti-aliasing filter is present, but the cutoff frequency is specified at 50 Hz, which might not be sufficient to avoid aliasing, depending on the sampling rate.\n7. There is a filter to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which meets the requirement.\n8. The filter has a cutoff frequency at 100 Hz, which is lower than the 500 Hz mentioned in the requirements, and the order of the filter is not specified, so it is unclear if the -20 dB gain at 500 Hz is achieved.\n\nThe main concern is that the anti-aliasing filter's cutoff frequency is specified at 50 Hz, which might not be sufficient for a sampling rate of 1000 samples per second (the Nyquist frequency would be 500 Hz). To ensure no aliasing, the cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter should be below half the sampling rate (500 Hz in this case). Also, the gain stage should explicitly prevent any possibility of the DAQ input exceeding 7V, which is not clearly stated.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
