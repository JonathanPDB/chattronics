Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The provided summary outlines a water temperature measurement system using an NTC thermistor, which includes a linearization stage, amplification, and optional filtering to produce an output voltage suitable for measurement with a multimeter. Key aspects are as follows:

- The sensor used is an NTC thermistor (Vishay NTCLE100E3), meeting requirement 7.
- Linearization is achieved with a parallel resistor, optimized for the midrange temperature of 50°C, fulfilling requirement 4.
- The self-heating effect is addressed by limiting the bias current to 100 µA, satisfying requirement 8.
- The gain of the amplification stage is calculated to be 20, which is adequate to amplify a 1V input to a 20V output, meeting requirement 2. The justification for the gain is to ensure that the output voltage range is within 0 to 20 Volts (requirement 3), though the exact input voltage range is not specified.
- The architecture consists of a sensor, linearization stage, constant current source, amplification, filtering, and a voltage output stage, which aligns with the required architecture in requirement 6.

However, there are a couple of points that need further clarification or correction:

- The output voltage range is specified to be between 0 and 20 Volts, but the system design mentions a gain that could potentially exceed the upper limit due to a gain of 21 in the voltage output stage. This could lead to an output voltage that exceeds the specified range under certain conditions.
- The gain provided in the amplification stage is justified, but the summary does not explicitly mention the input voltage range that is being amplified. For a solid verdict, the input range that results in the 0-20V output after amplification should be clarified.

The summary does not contain any fatal flaws or conceptually wrong information, and the project appears to be theoretically correct and implementable. However, due to the lack of specificity regarding the input voltage range and the potential for the output voltage to exceed the specified range, the verdict is "acceptable."
