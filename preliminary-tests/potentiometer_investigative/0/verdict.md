Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project description outlines a pendulum angle measurement system that incorporates a potentiometer, a buffer stage, a low-pass filter, an attenuator, an ADC, and a DAQ system for interfacing with LabVIEW. The design elements are as follows:

1. The potentiometer is used for angle sensing, which aligns with the requirement of being part of a voltage divider.
2. The power supply of Â±12V for the op-amp in the buffer stage suggests that the voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the +/- 10 V range, which is acceptable.
3. The architecture is described as simple and includes a voltage divider, a low-pass filter, and a DAQ system, which meets the requirement of simplicity.
4. The attenuator is designed to scale the voltage to DAQ-compatible levels, targeting a +/- 7V input voltage for the DAQ.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is ensured to be 7V by the design of the attenuator, which is crucial.
6. A low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 40 Hz addresses the requirement to avoid aliasing, although the exact anti-aliasing performance would depend on the sampling rate of the ADC and DAQ.
7. There is a mention of a low-pass filter to eliminate power line noise, which typically is around 50 to 60 Hz. However, the cutoff frequency is stated at 40 Hz, which might not be entirely sufficient to remove all noise in the 50-60 Hz range.
8. The low-pass filter is described as a second-order filter. There is no explicit mention of additional filtering that would add up to an order of at least 3, unless the digital processing in LabVIEW includes additional filtering that could meet this requirement.

Overall, the design appears to fulfill most of the requirements, but there is some uncertainty regarding the complete elimination of the 50-60 Hz noise and whether the filter order adds up to at least 3 with the inclusion of digital processing.
