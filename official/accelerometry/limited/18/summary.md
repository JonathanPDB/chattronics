Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device Design

Sensor:
- Selected Sensor: Dytran 3225M36 piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g.
- Operating Temperature Range: -40°C to +85°C.
- Size and Weight: Compact and lightweight design suitable for portable devices.
- Shock and Vibration Resistance: Robust to withstand significant levels of shock and vibration.

Charge Amplifier:
- Gain (G) Calculation: To achieve a 1 Vpp output for a peak charge (Q_peak) of 162.28 pC, G = 1 V / 162.28 pC ≈ 6.16 * 10^6 V/C.
- Feedback Capacitor (C_f): Chosen as 10 pF.
- Feedback Resistor (R_f): Selected as 68 MΩ for a cutoff frequency of 0.25 Hz, R_f = 1 / (2 * π * 0.25 Hz * 10 pF) ≈ 63.66 MΩ.
- Operational Amplifier: An ultra-low bias current op-amp like the LMC662 is used to minimize offset voltage.

Low Pass Filter:
- Topology: Active multiple-feedback design.
- Filter Type: 4th-order Butterworth with a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz.
- Op-Amp: AD8628 or equivalent with low input bias current, low offset voltage, and low noise.
- Component Values: Component values would be calculated based on standard Butterworth coefficients, within the range of 10 nF to 100 nF for capacitors to maintain practical resistor sizes.

Output Stage:
- Topology: Non-Inverting Op-Amp configuration.
- Supply Voltage: +5V for single-supply operation.
- Op-Amp Selection: Low-power, low-noise op-amps like Texas Instruments OPA333 or Analog Devices AD8605.
- Gain Adjustability: A potentiometer in the feedback loop for adjustable gain.
- Feedback Components: Rf and Cf values to match expected gain, with additional series resistor Rs for bias current balancing.

ADC:
- Type: 16-bit Sigma-Delta (ΣΔ) ADC with a differential input.
- Sampling Rate: At least 10 SPS to capture the low-frequency signal with sufficient detail.
- Input Range: Set to match the 1 V peak-to-peak range from the charge amplifier, adjusted for the 10 mV offset.
- Interface: I2C or SPI for data transfer to the microcontroller.
- Differential Input: Preferred to minimize common-mode noise in a portable device environment.

Overall Considerations:
- The entire design is focused on ensuring the fidelity of the low-frequency vibration signal from the sensor through to the digital domain, with attention to power consumption for portability. 
- The analog front-end maintains a high signal-to-noise ratio while the ADC provides high-resolution digital conversion.
- The system is designed to be robust against environmental factors and low power consumption for battery operation.
