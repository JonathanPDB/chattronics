Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System generally addresses the requirements provided, but there are some issues that need to be addressed:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, which meets the first requirement.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is not explicitly stated to be +/- 10 V, but since it is mentioned that a maximum output voltage of about 6.98V is produced when the potentiometer is at 10V, it can be inferred that the voltage applied is within the required range.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider and a unity gain buffer, which is in line with the simplicity requirement.
4. The voltage divider is designed to ensure that the DAQ input voltage is centered in 0, with a maximum output voltage of about 6.98V, which is close to the required +/- 7V.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is stated to be slightly below the 7V limit, which is acceptable.
6. The inclusion of a Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter acts as an anti-aliasing filter, meeting this requirement.
7. A Twin-T Notch Filter is used to attenuate frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, fulfilling this requirement.
8. The filter design specifics such as cutoff frequency and order are not provided for the Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter, which should have a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz to satisfy this requirement. This information is crucial to determine if the filter design is adequate.

Based on the information given, the project is close to meeting all requirements but lacks the specific details on the low-pass filter's performance at 500 Hz. Assuming the designer has chosen appropriate values for the filter components, the system could be "acceptable." However, the actual performance at 500 Hz is essential to determine if this requirement is fully met, and without this information, the project cannot be considered "optimal."
