1. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter should be between 0 and 20 Volts.
2. The temperature that will be measured is between 10 and 90 degrees celsius.
3. The self heating effect must be considered and must be less than 1%.
4. There should be no ADC other than the one inside the multimeter (which can't be changed).
5. All conditioning should be done in the analog domain
6. The sensor to be used is a NTC Vishay NTCLE100E3.
7. The NTC must be linearized for the midpoint of the input range by a resistor in parallel
