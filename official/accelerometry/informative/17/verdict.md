Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The provided design overview for the portable low-frequency vibration measurement device includes a detailed description of the charge amplifier, sensor, low-pass filter, buffer, ADC, and digital processing block. Here's an assessment based on the project requirements:

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) times the feedback capacitance (Cf) should be roughly around 2/pi. With Rf = 6.8 MΩ and Cf = 100 fF, Rf * Cf = 6.8 MΩ * 100 fF = 680 μs. This does not align with the requirement of being around 2/pi (approximately 0.637 μs), even allowing for a 10% difference.

2. The gain (G) of the charge amplifier is calculated to be 10^4 V/C. Multiplying this by 1.61E-12 and dividing by the feedback capacitance (Cf) of 100 fF, we get (10^4 V/C * 1.61E-12) / 100E-15 = 1.61, which is not roughly around 1, exceeding the 10% allowable difference.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly mentioned in the design overview, but if we consider the sensitivity of the accelerometer (100 pC/g) and a gmax of 1 g, the peak-to-peak charge output would be 100 pC, which is not the required 161 pC.

4. & 5. There is no explicit mention of the bias current or its relation to the feedback resistance.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which aligns with the requirements.

7. The project is designed for a 0.25 Hz low-frequency cutoff based on the feedback resistor and capacitor values, which contradicts the optimization for an input oscillation of 2 Hz.

8. The output voltage is specified as 1 V peak to peak, which aligns with the requirements.

9. There is no mention of the offset voltage or measures to keep it below 10 mV.

Due to the discrepancies in requirements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, the design cannot be considered optimal or acceptable. The project is theoretically correct in terms of using a charge amplifier for a piezoelectric sensor and has some correct elements, but key aspects such as feedback time constant, gain calculation, peak-to-peak charge output, and frequency optimization are not in line with the specified requirements. Therefore, the project is unfeasible as presented.
