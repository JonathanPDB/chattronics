Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device Design

Overall Architecture:
The proposed portable device architecture consists of the following main components:

1. Piezoelectric Accelerometer:
   - Model Suggestion: PCB Piezotronics model 352C33 or similar
   - Sensitivity: 100 pC/g
   - Operating Temperature Range: -40°C to +85°C
   - Environmental Considerations: Shock resistance, potential IP rating for dust and water resistance

2. Charge Amplifier:
   - Feedback Capacitor (Cf): 22 pF
   - Feedback Resistor (Rf): 27 MΩ (chosen to be close to calculated 28.9 MΩ for a 3 dB down point at 0.25 Hz)
   - Gain (Av): Approximately 510 kV/C
     - Calculations for Av:
       - Full-Scale Output Voltage (Vfs): 1 Vpp
       - Peak Acceleration (Ap): 0.0196 g (from 5 cm peak at 2 Hz)
       - Charge Generated (Qp): 1.96 pC
       - Av = Vfs / Qp ≈ 1 V / 1.96 pC = 510.2 kV/C
   - Operational Amplifier: Low-noise JFET input type for high input impedance and low bias current

3. Low-pass Filter:
   - Type: Second-order active Butterworth filter
   - Cut-off frequency (fc): 5 Hz
   - Components:
     - Capacitors (C1 = C2): 10 nF
     - Resistors (R1 = R2): 3.2 kΩ (standard value close to calculated 3.18 kΩ)

4. Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
   - Resolution: 12 bits
   - Sampling Rate: 10 samples per second (sps)
   - Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (THD+N): Less than 0.05%
   - Input Range: ±0.5 V or suitable range matching the charge amplifier's output
   - Interface: SPI or I2C

5. Microcontroller Unit (MCU):
   - Suggested Models: ARM Cortex-M series (e.g., STM32) or TI MSP430 series for low power
   - Communication: Support for SPI or I2C for ADC data acquisition
   - User Interface: Control of a display, buttons, and possibly LEDs
   - Data Processing: Real-time signal processing and basic statistical analysis

6. Display Interface:
   - Display Type: Monochrome LCD
   - Size: 2.0 to 3.5 inches
   - Resolution: 128x64 pixels
   - Backlight: LED, controllable to save power
   - Communication Interface: Parallel or SPI

Implementation Considerations:
- All components should be selected with portability and power efficiency in mind, considering a standard industrial temperature range for operation.
- The microcontroller should be programmed to process the digital data from the ADC in real-time and provide an immediate display of the measured vibration levels.
- The accelerometer selection should account for environmental durability, sensor sensitivity, and operating temperature range.
- The charge amplifier must be designed to match the sensitivity of the accelerometer and desired output voltage while maintaining offset voltage below 10 mV.
- The low-pass filter should effectively remove high-frequency noise while preserving the integrity of the measured signal.
- The ADC must have sufficient resolution and sampling rate to capture the signal accurately without significant distortion.
- The display interface should provide clear and immediate feedback to the user, with considerations for power saving.
- Power management features will be considered essential for the MCU to extend battery life and ensure portable operation.
- Robust and noise-immune design practices must be applied throughout the device to ensure signal integrity and reliability.
