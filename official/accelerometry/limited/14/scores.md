Score: 4
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and feedback capacitance (C_f) are given as 3.9 MÎ© and 160 pF, respectively. The product of these values is R_f * C_f = 3.9e6 * 160e-12 = 0.624, which does not satisfy the requirement of being roughly around 2/pi (approximately 0.6366). This is more than a 10% difference.

2. The gain (G) is not explicitly provided for the charge amplifier, but it is mentioned for the gain stage (which is not the charge amplifier). Therefore, we cannot evaluate this requirement directly from the given information.

3. The maximum output charge (Q_max) is stated to be 160 pC, which is very close to the requirement of 161 pC and can be considered within an acceptable range of tolerance.

4. The bias current is not explicitly provided, and without this information, we cannot confirm whether it is indeed provided or not.

5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (R_f) must equal the bias current cannot be confirmed without the actual value of the bias current.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as mentioned in the description of the charge amplifier.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, as mentioned in the maximum acceleration measurement and anti-aliasing filter sections.

8. The output voltage is stated to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets the requirement.

9. The offset is required to be kept below 10 mV, and while a low-noise op-amp with low input bias current is used to minimize the offset voltage, the actual offset value is not provided. Therefore, we cannot confirm if this requirement is met just based on the information given.

From the summary, items 3, 6, 7, and 8 are met. Items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9 cannot be confirmed from the provided information.
