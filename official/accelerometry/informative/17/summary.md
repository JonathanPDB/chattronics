Design of a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Overview:
The project entails the development of a portable device for measuring low-frequency vibrations utilizing a piezoelectric accelerometer. The device includes several key stages: a charge amplifier to convert charge to voltage, a low-pass filter to remove unwanted frequencies, a buffer to maintain signal integrity, an ADC to digitize the signal, and a digital processing block for analysis.

Sensor:
- Piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g.
- A suggested sensor model is PCB Piezotronics 352C series or similar.

Charge Amplifier:
- Gain (G) calculation: G = Vout/Qin = 1V/(100 pC/g * gmax); assuming gmax = 1 g, G = 10^4 V/C.
- Feedback Capacitor (Cf) value: 100 fF (based on the desired gain).
- Feedback Resistor (Rf) value for a 0.25 Hz low-frequency cutoff: Rf ≈ 6.37 MΩ, rounded to 6.8 MΩ.
- Op-amp: FET input op-amp with low noise and low bias current.

Low Pass Filter:
- Second-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz.
- Component values (for a 5 Hz cutoff): R1 = R2 = 16 kΩ, C1 = C2 ≈ 2 uF.
- Quality factor (Q) for second-order Butterworth: 0.7071 (critical damping).

Buffer:
- Unity-gain voltage follower configuration.
- Op-amp: OPA333 or OPA344 for low power consumption and wide bandwidth.
- Decoupling Capacitors: 0.1 μF ceramic capacitors.

ADC:
- Type: Sigma-Delta ADC.
- Resolution: 16 bits.
- Sampling Rate: ≥10 Hz.
- Input Range: ±10 V (assumption; should be matched with the charge amplifier's output).
- Interface: SPI.

Digital Processing:
- Not specified; scalability is recommended to accommodate future requirements.
- Signal filtering, data analysis, and potentially data logging and communication capabilities.

Power Sources and Environmental Considerations:
- Assumed use of a standard single-supply voltage of 5V for portability.
- Environmental conditions and additional power constraints have not been specified and should be considered in the final design.

Note:
The provided component values and recommendations are based on assumptions and standard practices due to incomplete user specifications. Actual component selection and circuit implementation should be verified and potentially adjusted based on detailed project requirements and component specification sheets.
