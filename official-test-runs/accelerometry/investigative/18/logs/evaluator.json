    "response": "```explanations\nThe project summary provides information on the design of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device using a piezoelectric accelerometer and a charge amplifier among other components. To evaluate the project against the requirements:\n\n1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and capacitance (C_f) product is given as R_f = 620 kOhms and C_f = 1 nF. The product is R_f * C_f = 620e3 * 1e-9 = 0.620. The target value is 2/pi ≈ 0.637, and the difference is within 10%, so this requirement is met.\n2. The gain (G) of the charge amplifier is calculated to be 10^7 V/C. Multiplying the gain by 1.61E-12 and dividing by the feedback capacitance gives (G * 1.61E-12) / C_f = (10^7 * 1.61E-12) / 1e-9 = 16.1, which is not roughly around 1, so this requirement is not met.\n3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not specified, but the gain calculation assumes 100 pC of charge for 1 V output, which is not 161 pC as required, so this requirement is not met.\n4. The bias current is not explicitly provided in the summary, so this requirement is not met.\n5. The feedback resistance (R_f) is given as 620 kOhms. Therefore, 0.01 / R_f = 0.01 / 620e3 ≈ 16.13 nA. Since the bias current is not provided, this requirement is not met.\n6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, so this requirement is met.\n7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz as indicated by the frequency response of the accelerometer and the cutoff frequency of the charge amplifier and filters, but there are no explicit calculations provided in the summary to back this up, so this requirement is not met.\n8. The desired output voltage is assumed to be 1 V peak-to-peak based on the gain calculation, so this requirement is met.\n9. There is no mention of the offset voltage in the summary, so we cannot determine if the offset is kept below 10 mV. Therefore, this requirement is not met.\n\nBased on the information provided in the summary, the requirements met are 1, 6, and 8. The other requirements are either not met or there is not enough information to determine compliance.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n3\n```",
