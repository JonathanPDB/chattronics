Temperature Measurement System for Beaker Water Using Vishay NTCLE100E3 Thermistor

Overview:
This solution outlines a temperature measurement system designed to measure the temperature of water in a beaker using a Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor. The system produces an analog voltage output in the range of 0 to 20 Volts, which can be measured by a multimeter.

Thermistor:
- A Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor is used, with an assumed nominal resistance of 10kΩ at 25°C.
- The temperature range to be measured is 10°C to 90°C.
- The thermistor should be placed within a waterproof probe housing to prevent damage from the water.

Constant Current Source:
- Utilize a simple op-amp based constant current source topology with a pass transistor.
- The current range is assumed to be 100 µA to 1 mA to minimize self-heating in the thermistor.
- The power supply voltage has not been specified; a range that includes common values (5V, 12V, or 24V) should be considered.

Buffer Amplifier:
- Implement a unity gain buffer amplifier using an operational amplifier.
- The buffer provides high input impedance and low output impedance to prevent loading effects and maintain signal integrity.

Instrumentation Amplifier:
- Apply a three-op-amp instrumentation amplifier topology or a fixed-gain instrumentation amplifier for signal amplification.
- The gain should be adjustable or fixed, based on the expected voltage change across the thermistor, which is estimated to vary linearly from 0V (10°C) to 20V (90°C).
- Suggested ICs include AD620 or INA118 for high precision and low offset.

Level Shifter:
- Use an operational amplifier in a non-inverting configuration with a voltage divider to achieve the desired 0-20V output range.
- The voltage divider and gain of the op-amp circuit must be chosen such that the voltage range from the instrumentation amplifier is properly mapped to the 0-20V output range.

Anti-Aliasing Filter:
- A 2nd-order (two-pole) Butterworth Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz is recommended to filter out high-frequency noise.
- Use resistors of 100 kΩ and capacitors of 15.9 nF for the Sallen-Key filter design.
- This filter ensures signal fidelity with an attenuation rate of -12 dB/octave beyond the cutoff frequency.

ADC:
- A 12-bit SAR ADC with SPI or I2C interface is recommended.
- Power supply voltage for the ADC is assumed to match standard logic levels (3.3V or 5V).
- An internal reference voltage would be beneficial for accurate conversions.
- The sampling rate can be set to 1-10 Hz based on slow temperature changes.

Microcontroller:
- A general-purpose microcontroller with a built-in ADC, such as Arduino or STM32, is suggested.
- The microcontroller will process ADC values, perform temperature calculations, and handle any communication tasks.
- Power supply and operating temperature ranges are assumed to match typical values for general-purpose microcontrollers.

Voltage Output:
- A precision buffer amplifier with a rail-to-rail output capability is used to provide the final voltage output.
- A fine-tuning potentiometer in the level shifter is used for calibration.
- Include overvoltage and reverse polarity protection to prevent damage to the multimeter or the sensor circuit.

Measurement Technique:
- Calibrate the level shifter to align with the 0-20V range.
- Use shielded cables for long-distance connections to minimize noise.
- Set the multimeter to the appropriate voltage measurement range and convert the measured voltage to temperature using a lookup table or calibration curve.

Protection:
- Implement Zener diodes and series resistors or a dedicated IC for overvoltage and reverse polarity protection at the Voltage Output stage.

Note: The specific component values, especially for the thermistor resistance range, current source, and level shifter, will need to be calibrated based on the actual thermistor characteristics and the available supply voltage. The above topology and components are suggested based on standard practices and general assumptions.
