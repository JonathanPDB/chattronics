Score: 6
Explanations: 
The project summary addresses the following requirements:

1. The output is being measured by a multimeter: The summary explicitly states that the output voltage ranges from 0 to 20 Volts for measurement by a multimeter.
2. There should be an amplification stage with justification: The summary describes a gain stage with a non-inverting operational amplifier, and provides reasoning for the gain of 10 to 20 to achieve the 0 to 20V output range.
3. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is between 0 and 20 Volts: This is explicitly mentioned in the project summary.
4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50 ºC: The summary mentions the use of a voltage divider with a fixed resistor for linearization though it does not explicitly state it is optimized for 50 ºC.
5. The NTC is linearized: The linearization network is described, confirming that the NTC is linearized.
6. Architecture: The summary outlines a signal conditioning architecture consisting of a sensor (NTC), linearization stage, amplification, and optional filtering, which aligns with the requirement.
7. The sensor used is an NTC: The summary specifies the use of a Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor.
8. Self-heating effect: The summary does not mention the self-heating effect or the maximum current that passes through the NTC, thus this requirement is not met.

The requirements that are not met or are not explicitly confirmed in the summary are:
- Optimization of the linearization resistor for the midrange (50 ºC) is not explicitly stated.
- The self-heating effect and the maximum current through the NTC are not addressed.

Therefore, the project meets 6 out of the 8 requirements.
