Design a portable device capable of measuring a low-frequency vibration.
Make sure to calculate all components and overall values involved in the project, including maximum bias current, charge amplifier components considering a peak-to-peak voltage output.

Use a piezoelectric accelerometer
The accelerometer has a sensitivity of 100 pC/g (g is the acceleration due to gravity)
Use the peak to peak acceleration to calculate charge
An input oscillation has a frequency up to 2 Hz
The input oscillation has a peak amplification of 5 cm.
Output voltage should be 1 V peak to peak
Low frequency response of the system has to be 3 dB down at 0.25 Hz
The offset should be kept as less than 10 mV
