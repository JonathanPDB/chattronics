Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water in a Beaker

NTC Thermistor + Linearization Resistor:
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3103JB0, a common 10kΩ NTC thermistor at 25°C with a B-value of 3950K.
- Linearization Resistor: A parallel resistor, approximately 10kΩ, to linearize the sensor's response at the midpoint temperature of 50°C.
- Waterproofing: Necessary measures such as a protective sleeve or coating if the thermistor is not inherently waterproof.
- Self-heating: Limited to 1% by selecting a low power dissipation thermistor and good thermal coupling with the water.

Signal Conditioning:
- Configuration: Wheatstone bridge with the thermistor and linearization resistor as elements.
- Differential Voltage Output: Proportional to temperature-dependent resistance change of the thermistor.
- Excitation Source: DC voltage source under 5V to minimize self-heating of the thermistor.
- Bridge Output: Millivolt-level signal representing temperature changes.

Voltage Amplifier:
- Topology: Non-inverting operational amplifier configuration.
- Operational Amplifier: Precision op-amp with rail-to-rail output, low offset voltage, and low drift (e.g., AD8605 or OPAx177).
- Power Supply: Minimum 24V to ensure rail-to-rail operation and allow for a 20V output.
- Gain Calculation: Gain (G) of 0.25V/°C to map temperature range to 0-20V output.
- Feedback Resistors: To achieve the calculated gain, e.g., R1 = 10kΩ, R2 = 190kΩ (standard value closest to calculated gain, adjusted with trim pot if necessary).

Buffer/Output Stage:
- Topology: Operational amplifier based unity-gain buffer.
- Op-Amp: Precision op-amp like OPAx177 or AD8479.
- Feedback Resistors: Both Rf and Rin at 10kΩ for stability.
- Supply Decoupling Capacitors: 0.1 µF ceramic capacitors for noise filtering.
- Circuit Protection: Output series resistor (e.g., 100 Ω) and capacitor (e.g., 10 nF) for short circuit and noise protection.
- Overvoltage Protection: Zener diodes or transient voltage suppressors at the output.

Calculations and Considerations:
- Rp (linearization resistor) is chosen based on the thermistor's resistance at the target midpoint temperature of 50°C.
- Gain of the differential amplifier is set such that a temperature change of 1°C corresponds to a 0.25V change in output within the 80°C span.
- The bridge excitation voltage is selected to be adequately high for detectable output while low enough to prevent self-heating above the 1% threshold.
- The buffer/output stage is designed to not load the previous stage and to drive the high-impedance input of a multimeter without signal degradation.

The values and components suggested are based on standard practices and characteristics of common thermistors and operational amplifiers. Adjustments and fine-tuning may be necessary based on detailed specifications of the components and the application environment.
