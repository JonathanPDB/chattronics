Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a detailed description of an analog pendulum angle measurement system with a voltage divider, amplifier, filtering stages, and a DAQ system. Each component is specified with initial values that can be adjusted during prototyping. The main requirements will be evaluated as follows:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, which is correct.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V, as required.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, amplifier, and anti-aliasing filter before the DAQ, which is simple and correct.
4. The amplifier has a gain of 1.4x to ensure the DAQ input voltage is centered at 0, with a maximum of +/- 7V.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V due to the gain setting, which is essential and correct.
6. An anti-aliasing filter with a 2nd-order Butterworth low-pass filter is included, which should prevent aliasing.
7. There are notch filters for both 50Hz and 60Hz, which are designed to remove these frequencies.
8. The anti-aliasing filter has a cutoff frequency of 150Hz, which is not explicitly stated to achieve -20 dB at 500Hz, but given the 2nd order Butterworth design, it should provide at least -12 dB per octave rolloff. This should be sufficient to achieve at least -20 dB at 500Hz since it's more than an octave away from the cutoff frequency.

The project meets all essential requirements except for the explicit mention of the -20 dB gain at 500 Hz, but the design choice seems to suggest that it would meet this requirement. However, without explicit confirmation of the attenuation at 500Hz, the verdict is "acceptable" rather than "optimal."
