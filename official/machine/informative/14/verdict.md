Verdict: incorrect

Explanations: 
The project summary outlines an analog electronics design for machine monitoring that includes both pressure and infrared temperature sensors. Let's review the summary against the requirements:

1. Both sensors are specified to have DC output, meeting the requirement of no demodulation needed.
2. The pressure sensor and the IR temperature sensor are both interfaced with instrumentation amplifiers, ensuring amplification.
3. The pressure sensor is expected to be interfaced with an instrumentation amplifier, but there's no explicit mention of its insertion into a Wheatstone bridge, which is a concern since that is a requirement.
4. The use of SAR ADCs for both pressure and temperature signals satisfies the requirement for an ADC.
5. The summary does not provide specific details on how the IR sensors are being linearized, which is a critical requirement.
6. There is no clear mention of the sampling order strategy (sequential, simultaneous, etc.).
7. The ADC sampling rate for the pressure signals is specified to be greater than or equal to 800 Hz, satisfying this requirement.
8. The pressure sensor's low-pass filter has a cutoff frequency of 200 Hz, which is not explicitly stated to achieve -20 dB at half the sampling frequency, but given the sampling rate of at least 800 Hz, it implies a proper anti-aliasing filter design.
9. The cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter for the pressure sensor is 200 Hz, which is higher than 400 Hz and not explicitly lower than half the total sampling frequency, which may not satisfy this requirement depending on the actual sampling frequency used.
10. Low-pass filters are mentioned for both pressure and temperature signals, which would serve as anti-aliasing filters positioned before the multiplexer, but the temperature signal filter cutoff is 1-10 Hz, which doesn't align with the requirement for a cutoff frequency higher than 400 Hz.
11. The use of an 8:1 multiplexer satisfies the need for channel selection.
12. The CD74HC4051 is a solid-state multiplexer, meeting the solid-state requirement.

Overall, the project summary fails to address all of the necessary requirements. Notably, there's no explicit mention of the Wheatstone bridge for the pressure sensor, no details on how the IR sensors are being linearized, and the sampling order strategy is not discussed. The low-pass filter specifications also raise concerns about whether they meet the required criteria.
