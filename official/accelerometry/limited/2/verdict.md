Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project presents a well-detailed design of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device utilizing a piezoelectric sensor and charge amplifier among other components. However, there are discrepancies regarding the requirements provided:

1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and feedback capacitance (C_f) product is given by 63.7 MΩ * 10 pF = 637 μs, which is significantly different from the required 2/π ≈ 0.637 μs. This is not within the allowed 10% difference.

2. The charge amplifier gain is not explicitly provided, making it challenging to verify the second requirement (G x 1.61p / C_f). However, since the output voltage is expected to be 1 Vpp with a charge of 80 pC (calculated peak charge), the gain can be estimated as G = Vpp / Q_peak = 1 V / 80 pC = 12.5 MV/C. Using this estimated gain, (G x 1.61p / C_f) = (12.5 MV/C x 1.61p / 10 pF) = 2.0125, which deviates significantly from the requirement of being roughly around 1, allowing up to 10% difference.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output calculated in the project is 80 pC, which does not match the required 161 pC.

4. The bias current is not provided, nor is there information to calculate it based on the provided feedback resistance value.

5. The requirement that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current cannot be verified due to the lack of information regarding the bias current.

6. The use of a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor is in line with the requirements.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, with calculations to back it up, fulfilling this requirement.

8. The output voltage is expected to be 1 V peak-to-peak, which meets the requirement.

9. The offset voltage requirement is not explicitly addressed, but op-amps with low offset voltage have been suggested, which could imply the design intends to meet this specification.

Given these points, the project does not meet the essential requirements 1, 2, 3, and 4. The feedback components' values are off by a large margin, the calculated peak charge output is incorrect, and the bias current information is missing. Therefore, the project cannot be considered optimal or acceptable. Since the project is theoretically correct and could potentially be implemented with significant adjustments, it does not fall into the "incorrect" category. However, it is not just a theoretical exercise and does have real-world application, so "generic" is also not appropriate. The verdict is "unfeasible" because, while the project is theoretically correct, it contains elements that make it impossible to implement as it currently stands.
