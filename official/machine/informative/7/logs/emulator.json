Furthermore, since the pressure sensors have a maximum output of 1 mV and the temperature sensors have a maximum output of 100 mV, amplification may be required to match the input range of the ADC for optimal resolution. Additionally, because temperature sensors have a nonlinear scale, linearization may be needed to ensure accurate temperature readings after digitization.
