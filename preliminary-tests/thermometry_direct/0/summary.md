Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water Beaker

The proposed architecture encompasses the following blocks: NTC Thermistor (Sensor), Linearization Resistor, Buffer Amplifier, Gain Stage, Level Shifter, Low-pass Filter, and Output Stage. The system is designed to measure the temperature of water within a 10°C to 90°C range, outputting a voltage range of 0 to 20V, measurable by a multimeter.

NTC Thermistor (Sensor):
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor, typically 10kΩ at 25°C.
- Temperature Range: 10°C to 90°C.

Linearization Resistor:
- Goal: Linearize the NTC thermistor response around 50°C.
- Estimated Resistance at 50°C: R_T = R25 * exp(B * (1/T - 1/T25)) assuming R25 = 10kΩ and B-value = 3950K.
- Resistance of Linearization Resistor (R_lin): Chosen to match the resistance of the thermistor at 50°C, approximately 3.57kΩ.
- Suggestion: Select R_lin as 3.6kΩ with 1% tolerance and a low temperature coefficient (e.g., 50 ppm/°C).

Buffer Amplifier:
- High input impedance: >1M ohms.
- Low output impedance: <100 ohms.
- Low offset voltage: <1mV.
- Low bias current: <10pA.
- Bandwidth: About 10Hz.
- Example Op-Amp: TL081 or AD8603.

Gain Stage:
- Gain Calculation: Assuming a thermistor output range of 0.1V to 1V, a gain of 20 is needed to reach a 0-20V output.
- Op-Amp Suggestion: TLV2471 or similar rail-to-rail precision amplifier.
- Resistors for Gain: Rf = 19kΩ, Ri = 1kΩ with a trimpot in series with Rf for fine-tuning.
- Power Supply: Regulated to +15V from a 24V supply.
- Bypass Capacitors: 0.1uF ceramic capacitors close to the op-amp's power supply pins.

Level Shifter:
- Adjustment: An adjustable DC bias to fine-tune the output voltage.
- Op-Amp: Rail-to-rail output capability, possibly powered with a single 24V supply regulated to the appropriate level.
- Resistor Values: If Gain Stage output is 1V to 5V, set gain at 4 with R1 = 1kΩ and R2 = 3kΩ.
- Adjustable Reference: A potentiometer or precision voltage reference to set the required DC bias.

Low-pass Filter:
- Topology: Active Butterworth low-pass filter.
- Order: Second Order.
- Cutoff Frequency: 0.1 Hz.
- Q factor: 0.707 for critical damping.
- Op-Amp: TL072 or LM358.
- Resistors: R1 = R2 = 100 kΩ.
- Capacitors: C1 = C2 = 15.9 uF.
- Attenuation: Frequencies above 0.1 Hz will be attenuated.

Output Stage:
- Voltage Follower (Buffer) or Non-Inverting Amplifier, depending on whether additional gain is required.
- Op-Amp: Low offset voltage, low bias current, rail-to-rail output, e.g., LM324 or TL074.
- Feedback Resistor (if Non-Inverting Amplifier is used): Rf 4 times the value of the input resistor Rin, e.g., Rin = 10k ohms, Rf = 40k ohms for a gain of 4.

The system should be prototyped and calibrated to ensure that each stage is correctly set up to achieve the desired temperature measurement accuracy and output voltage range. Component values may be further adjusted based on real-world behavior during prototyping and testing.
