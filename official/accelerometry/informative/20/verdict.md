Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The provided project description outlines the design of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device using a piezoelectric sensor and a charge amplifier, among other components. However, to assess the project against the given requirements, we need to focus on the specifics of the charge amplifier design.

1. The feedback resistance (Rf) is given as 15 MΩ and the feedback capacitance (Cf) as 50 nF. The product of Rf and Cf is 15e6 * 50e-9 = 0.75 s. This value must be compared to 2/pi, which is approximately 0.6366 s. The RfCf product is 17.8% greater than 2/pi, which exceeds the 10% difference allowed by the requirements. This does not meet requirement 1.

2. The charge amplifier gain (G) is not explicitly provided. However, without this value, we cannot verify the second requirement regarding the gain, charge, and feedback capacitance relationship.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not specified in the project description. Without this information, we cannot verify if the peak-to-peak charge output is around 161 pC as required.

4. The bias current is not explicitly mentioned. However, since the bias current is related to the feedback resistor (requirement 5), we could infer it if requirement 5 is satisfied.

5. Requirement 5 states that 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance (Rf) must equal the bias current. With Rf given as 15 MΩ, the bias current should be 0.01 / 15e6 = 666.67 pA. This information is not provided, and thus we cannot verify compliance with this requirement.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is in line with requirement 6.

7. The project is designed to measure up to 2 Hz, which aligns with requirement 7. However, no specific calculations are provided to verify that the design is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude.

8. The output voltage of 1 V peak to peak is not specified in the project description. Without this information, we cannot verify if the design meets requirement 8.

9. The offset voltage is not discussed in the project description. Consequently, we cannot ascertain if it is kept below 10 mV as required by requirement 9.

Given the information provided, several key requirements are not addressed or are missing from the project description. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the project meets all essential requirements.
