Design of a Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Piezoelectric Accelerometer:
- Recommended model: PCB Piezotronics Model 352C33 or similar with 100 pC/g sensitivity.
- Expected peak acceleration: 4.027 g based on the given peak displacement of 5 cm at 2 Hz.
- Maximum expected charge (\(Q_{max}\)): \(402.7 \text{pC}\).

Charge Amplifier:
- Topology: Inverting operational amplifier with feedback capacitor (\(C_f\)) and feedback resistor (\(R_f\)).
- \(C_f\) selection: \(470 \text{pF}\) (standard value close to calculated 402.7 pF).
- \(R_f\) selection: \(100 \text{M}\Omega\) to provide a discharge path for \(C_f\).
- Operational Amplifier: Low input bias current, low offset voltage, wide bandwidth, FET-input or CMOS op-amp (e.g., OPAx132 series, AD823 series).

Low-pass Filter:
- Topology: First-order RC low-pass filter or active low-pass filter.
- Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\)): 0.25 Hz.
- Component values (if using RC topology): \(R = 10 \text{k}\Omega\), \(C = 68 \text{μF}\) (standard value close to calculated 63.66 μF).
- For active low-pass filter: Low-noise op-amp with a bandwidth greater than 20 Hz (e.g., LT1054).

Gain Stage:
- Multi-stage amplification required due to high gain.
- First stage gain: 40 dB (Voltage gain \(A_{v1} = 100\)).
- Second stage gain: 47 dB (Voltage gain \(A_{v2} = 230\)).
- Operational Amplifiers: Low-noise, suitable for low-frequency operations (e.g., AD797, OPA211).

Anti-aliasing Filter:
- Topology: Second-order Butterworth low-pass filter.
- Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\)): 5 Hz.
- Order: Second.
- Passband Ripple: <0.1 dB.
- Stopband Attenuation: >60 dB.
- Operational Amplifier: Low noise figure, sufficient bandwidth (if active filter is used).

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
- Resolution: 16-bit.
- Sampling rate: At least 50 Hz.
- SNR: > 90 dB.
- THD: < 0.01%.
- Single supply voltage operation (3.3V or 5V).
- Input bandwidth: Adequate to match the low-pass filter passband.

Calculation of Expected Charge for Maximum Vibration:
- Peak displacement to meters: \(0.05 \text{m}\).
- Maximum acceleration (\(a_{max}\)): \(39.478 \text{m/s}^2\).
- Acceleration in terms of gravity (\(a_{max\_g}\)): \(4.027 \text{g}\).
- Maximum expected charge (\(Q_{max}\)): \(402.7 \text{pC}\).

Calculation of Gain Stage Values:
- Charge to voltage conversion (initial): \(100 \text{pC} / 1 \text{μF} = 100 \text{μV}\).
- Desired voltage for ADC input: 2.3V peak.
- Required voltage gain: 2.3V / 100 μV = 23,000.
- Multi-stage gain division: First stage \(A_{v1} = 100\), second stage \(A_{v2} = 230\).

The design considerations provided address the conversion of low-frequency mechanical vibrations into a digital signal for analysis or monitoring, taking into account the sensitivity of the sensor, the expected vibration amplitude, and standard electronic design principles.
