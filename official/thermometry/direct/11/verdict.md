Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a detailed description of an analog temperature measurement system that incorporates an NTC thermistor (NTCLE100E3) in a Wheatstone bridge configuration, linearization, amplification, and filtering stages. The main requirements are addressed as follows:

1. The output voltage range is specified to be between 0 and 20 Volts, which is within the desired measurement range for the multimeter.
2. An amplification stage with a gain of 200 is mentioned for the differential amplifier, and a rationale is provided for this gain value—it maps the estimated bridge output to the desired output range.
3. The NTC thermistor is used as the temperature sensor, fulfilling the requirement for the sensor type.
4. Linearization is achieved through the use of a resistor similar to the thermistor's resistance at the midpoint temperature (50°C), which indicates an understanding of the need for linearization at the specified temperature.
5. Self-heating is addressed by designing the circuit with high-value resistors to keep self-heating effects below 1%.

However, there are some concerns and missing details:

- It is not clear if the linearization is effective across the entire operating temperature range, as the explanation focuses on the resistor being optimized for 50°C. More information would be needed to confirm that the NTC is indeed linearized across its range, as this is a critical requirement.
- The summary does not provide the maximum current that passes through the NTC, which is necessary to ensure the self-heating effect is taken into account adequately.
- The buffer amplifier is mentioned to have unity gain, which seems to be a separate stage from the differential amplifier. This could potentially be an issue if the buffer stage does not provide the needed signal conditioning before amplification.

The explanation does not explicitly state that all requirements have been met, particularly regarding the effective linearization across the entire operating range and the maximum current through the NTC. Therefore, while the design seems to be well thought out, there is insufficient information to confirm that all essential requirements have been fully satisfied.
