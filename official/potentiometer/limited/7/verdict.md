Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a detailed outline for a pendulum angle measurement system, which includes various stages of signal conditioning and filtering before the data acquisition (DAQ) process. The following points assess the compliance with the given requirements:

1. The potentiometer is correctly used as a voltage divider, with its output expected to vary between -5V and +5V for the pendulum's angular range.
2. The power supply for the potentiometer and operational amplifiers is stated to be ±10V, which aligns with the requirement.
3. The architecture is relatively simple, consisting of a buffer, gain stage, filters, and a DAQ system.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0V, with a range of ±7V, meeting the specified requirement.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is within the ±7V limit, as ensured by the gain stage design.
6. There is a mention of an anti-aliasing filter with a second-order Sallen-Key low-pass topology and a cutoff frequency of approximately 210 Hz, which should help mitigate aliasing.
7. The band-pass filter includes a Twin-T notch filter to attenuate 50 Hz and 60 Hz, which would effectively remove unwanted frequencies from the power line interference.
8. The low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 200 Hz and a second-order response would have a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, as it would roll off at -12 dB/octave beyond the cutoff frequency.

The design appears to be well thought out and should be capable of meeting the project requirements. However, the summary does not explicitly mention the gain at 500 Hz for the anti-aliasing filter. Although it can be inferred that the filter would meet the -20 dB requirement at 500 Hz due to the filter order and cutoff frequency, this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the gain stage calculation does not consider the effect of the voltage follower's finite gain and output impedance on the overall system gain, which might be important for precision.

Despite these minor concerns, the project summary suggests that the design is well within the acceptable range and does not contain fatal issues.
