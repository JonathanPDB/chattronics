1. The output is being measured by a multimeter
2. There should be amplification stage and the gain must be provided and justified
3. The output voltage range to be measured by the multimeter is between 0 and 20 Volts
4. The NTC is linearized by a resistor optimised for the midrange 50 ÂºC .
5. The NTC is linearized (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
6. The architecture should be roughly consisting of the sensor, a linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering and measurement. Or some variation not too far off of this.
7. The sensor used is an NTC (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
8. The self heating effect is taken into account and there the maximum current that passes through the NTC is known.
