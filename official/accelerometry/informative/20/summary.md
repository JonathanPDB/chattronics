DESIGN OF A PORTABLE LOW-FREQUENCY VIBRATION MEASUREMENT DEVICE

Piezoelectric Sensor Block:
- Sensor Type: Piezoelectric accelerometer (suggested model: PCB Piezotronics Model 352C22)
- Sensitivity: 100 pC/g
- Measurement Amplitude: Peak of 5 cm at a frequency up to 2 Hz
- Operating Temperature Range: Typically -40°C to +85°C (standard industrial range)
- Power Supply Requirements: Usually, 2 to 20 mA at 18 to 30 VDC provided by the charge amplifier
- Resolution and Dynamic Range: High resolution is necessary to capture the full range of motion with a good signal-to-noise ratio

Charge Amplifier:
- Op-amp Model: LMC6001 or OPA128 for low leakage and low power consumption
- Feedback Capacitor (Cf): 50 nF (ceramic or film type for stability and low leakage)
- Feedback Resistor (Rf): 15 MΩ (metal film or precision resistor for accuracy)
- Input Resistor (Ri): 1 MΩ (value chosen based on op-amp's input characteristics)

Low Pass Filter:
- Topology: Active Butterworth filter using operational amplifier
- Order: Second-order (2 poles)
- Cutoff Frequency: 5 Hz (to minimize signal attenuation and allow for noise attenuation)
- Resistor (R): 1 kΩ
- Capacitor (C): 33 nF (standard value close to calculated 31.8 nF)
- Damping Factor: √2/2 (characteristic of Butterworth filter)

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):
- Type: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC or Delta-Sigma for higher resolution
- Resolution: 16-bit (provides high accuracy without being overly expensive or power-hungry)
- Sampling Rate: At least 10 SPS (to ensure better signal reconstruction)
- SNR: At least 90 dB (to maintain the integrity of vibration data)
- Communication Protocol: SPI or I2C (for flexibility and compatibility with microcontrollers)

Output Interface:
- The details of the output interface are unspecified. However, it would typically include software and hardware configurations to transmit data to a display, storage, or communication device. The selection of protocols and interfaces should be based on the end application, data rate, power consumption, connectivity requirements, and compatibility with external systems or devices.

Overall, the suggested components provide a robust framework for a portable device capable of measuring low-frequency vibration with high fidelity, suitable for a range of applications where specific end-use requirements can be further defined and addressed in the final design implementation.
