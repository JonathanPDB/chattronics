Analog Instrumentation System for Pressure and Temperature Monitoring

Pressure Sensor Array:
- Sensors: Strain-gauge pressure sensors, assumed range 0 to 10 bar (0 to 1000 kPa), sensitivity of 1 mV/bar.
- Recommended Model: Honeywell Model FP2000 series or similar, with necessary calibration for 1% accuracy, temperature compensation, and proper shielding for noise rejection.

Temperature Sensor Array:
- Sensors: Infrared radiation temperature sensors, assumed range -40°C to +125°C.
- Recommended Model: Melexis MLX90614 or similar, with built-in 17-bit ADC, minimal emissivity configuration, and proper field of view adjustment.
- Resolution: Factory-calibrated sensitivity with linearized output over the temperature range.

Instrumentation Amplifier Array (Pressure):
- Topology: Monolithic instrumentation amplifiers for simplicity and high CMRR.
- Gain: Assuming a minimum output voltage of 1 µV from the pressure sensors and an ADC input range of 5 V, a gain of 5000 (74 dB) is required.
- Recommended Amplifier: Devices with low noise density (<10 nV/√Hz) and low temperature drift (<5 µV/°C), such as the AD623.

Instrumentation Amplifier Array (Temperature):
- Since the MLX90614 outputs a digital signal, traditional amplification is not required. However, a buffering stage to adapt the sensor's I2C or PWM output to the multiplexer and ADC might be necessary.

Non-Linear Correction (Temperature):
- Correction Technique: Second-order polynomial correction using operational amplifier networks.
- Component Selection: Precision resistors (10kΩ, 0.1% tolerance) and op-amps with low offset voltage and drift (e.g., AD8628).

Multiplexer:
- Configuration: Dual 8-channel analog multiplexer/demultiplexer ICs, one for pressure and one for temperature, or a single 16-channel multiplexer.
- Recommended ICs: CD74HC4051 for dual 8-channel configurations or ADG726 for a single 16-channel setup.
- Additional Components: Pull-up resistors (10kΩ) and decoupling capacitors (0.1µF ceramic) for control lines and power supply pins.

Low-Pass Filter:
- Topology: Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter.
- Type: Second-Order Active Filter with a Butterworth response.
- Cutoff Frequency: 500 Hz to adequately attenuate frequencies above 400 Hz.
- Stop-Band Attenuation: -40 dB at 800 Hz.
- Damping Factor (Q): 0.707 for a maximally flat pass-band.
- Component Values: Precision resistors (1% tolerance) and capacitors (5% tolerance).

ADC:
- Type: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC.
- Resolution: 12-bit to preserve the 1% accuracy requirement.
- Sampling Rate: 1 kSps per channel to meet the Nyquist criterion.
- Voltage Range: Compatible with pressure and temperature sensor outputs, adjustable if necessary using a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA).
- Interface: SPI or I2C for high data transfer rates.

Computer Interface:
- Data Buffering: To manage incoming data streams.
- Digital Filtering: To clean up the signal.
- Data Decimation: If necessary, to reduce sampling rate for efficient processing.
- Signal Conditioning: Scaling and calibrating digital counts into engineering units.
- Data Packaging: Formatting data for transmission, including error-checking codes.
- Interface Protocol Handling: Managing communication specifics, including handshaking and addressing.
- Data Transmission: Handling serialization and sending data over chosen digital interface (USB or Ethernet recommended).
- Data Storage: Storing data on the computer in a suitable format for later analysis.

Note: Precision components and careful PCB layout are crucial due to the high gains and low signal levels involved. The implementation should consider thermal management, noise reduction, and proper grounding techniques. Final design adjustments may be necessary once detailed system requirements and operational conditions are known.
