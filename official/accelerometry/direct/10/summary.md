Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device

Piezoelectric Accelerometer:
- Model: Endevco 2271A series or equivalent with 100 pC/g sensitivity.
- Operating Temperature Range: -40°C to +85°C.
- Frequency Response: Flat up to at least 2 Hz, low-frequency cutoff at or below 0.25 Hz with 3 dB point.

Charge Amplifier:
- Feedback Capacitor (C_f): 10 pF.
- Feedback Resistor (R_f): 62 MΩ.
- Operational Amplifier: Low-noise JFET input, e.g., LMC662, for low input bias current and low noise.
- The charge amplifier's gain is defined as the output voltage over the input charge (V_out_peak / Q_in_peak). With the peak charge (Q_in_peak) of 0.51 pC from the accelerometer and desired output (V_out_peak) of 0.5 V peak, the feedback capacitor (C_f) was calculated to be approximately 1.02 pF. However, a more practical value of 10 pF was chosen for C_f with a corresponding feedback resistor (R_f) of 62 MΩ for ease of implementation and availability.

Low-pass Filter:
- Configuration: Active single-pole RC filter with a -3 dB cutoff at 0.25 Hz.
- Components for First-order RC Filter:
  - Resistor: 620 kΩ (standard value closest to calculated 623.5 MΩ).
  - Capacitor: 10 μF (chosen standard value).

Signal Conditioning:
- Instrumentation Amplifier: AD8421, INA128, or similar for precision and low noise.
- High-Pass Filter: Cutoff at 0.25 Hz with R = 1 MOhm and C = 638 nF (calculated).
- Low-Pass Filter: Cutoff around 20 Hz with R = 10 kΩ and C = 0.797 µF (calculated).
- Offset Correction: Potentiometer in conjunction with an op-amp for nulling DC offset.

Buffer Amplifier:
- Configuration: Voltage follower using an op-amp such as OPA132 for low noise and low offset voltage.
- Gain: 1 (unity).
- Load Impedance: Capable of driving loads down to 10 kΩ.
- Bandwidth: At least 10 Hz to account for higher harmonic content.

ADC:
- Type: SAR ADC for an adequate balance between speed, power consumption, and resolution.
- Resolution: 16-bit to provide a fine granularity in vibration measurement with a resolution of approximately 15.3 µV per bit.
- Sampling Rate: At least 10 Hz to ensure good signal reconstruction.
- Input Range: 0 to 1 V or ±0.5 V (differential) to accommodate the 1 Vpp signal level.

Anti-aliasing Filter:
- Type: Second-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a Butterworth response.
- Cutoff Frequency: Approximately 5 Hz to ensure sufficient attenuation before reaching the Nyquist limit.
- Components: Equal resistors R1 = R2 = 3.2 kΩ (standard value close to calculated 3.18 kΩ) and equal capacitors C1 = C2 = 10 nF.

Output:
- Configuration: Voltage follower with EMI/RFI filtering and protection circuitry.
- EMI/RFI Filtering: Ferrite bead on the output line and a small capacitor (100 nF) to ground for noise suppression.
- Protection: Series resistor (100 Ohms) and clamping diodes for ESD protection.
- DC Block: 1 µF coupling capacitor to eliminate any remaining DC offset.

Overall, the device should be able to measure low-frequency vibrations effectively with the proposed configurations, ensuring low noise, proper signal integrity, and compliance with general portable device standards for usability and robustness.
