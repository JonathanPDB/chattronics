Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project summary provides a comprehensive design for a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device using a piezoelectric accelerometer. Here's an assessment based on the provided requirements:

1. The given feedback resistance (R_f) is 1 MΩ and the feedback capacitance (C_f) is 820 pF. The product of these values is 820 x 10^-12 F * 1 x 10^6 Ω = 820 x 10^-6 = 0.82, which is not roughly around 2/pi (approximately 0.637). This does not meet the first requirement.

2. Using the values provided, the expression 1.61p/C_f * G is calculated as 1.61p/820pF * 625 ≈ 1.96, which is not roughly around 1, hence the second requirement is not fulfilled.

3. The maximum expected charge (Qmax) is calculated to be 402.5 pC, which is significantly greater than the requirement of a peak-to-peak charge output of around 161 pC. This does not meet the third requirement.

4. The bias current has not been provided in the summary, which does not fulfill the fourth requirement.

5. The bias current is not provided, so the relationship between 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance and the bias current cannot be verified. The fifth requirement is not met.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which meets the sixth requirement.

7. The project appears to be optimized for an input oscillation of 2Hz and 5cm amplitude as it includes filters set below and above this frequency. However, the calculations backing this up are not explicitly provided in the summary, so it is unclear whether the seventh requirement is fully met.

8. The output voltage is designed to be 1V peak to peak, which satisfies the eighth requirement.

9. The offset voltage has not been specified in the summary, therefore it is not possible to determine if it is less than 10mV, leaving the ninth requirement unverified.

The project fails to meet several essential requirements, including the specified relationships involving the feedback resistance and capacitance, the peak-to-peak charge output, the provision of bias current, and the calculation of the offset voltage. Therefore, the project cannot be considered "optimal" or "acceptable". It is not "generic" as it does target a specific application. It is not "incorrect" as the concepts applied are valid in the field of analog electronics design. However, due to the failure to meet several key requirements that affect the feasibility of the project, the project is deemed "unfeasible".
