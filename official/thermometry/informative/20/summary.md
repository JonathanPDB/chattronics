Design for an Analog Water Temperature Measurement System

The proposed system will measure the temperature of water in a beaker using a Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor and output a voltage range of 0 to 20 volts suitable for measurement with a multimeter.

1. NTC Thermistor:
   - Choose a 10kΩ NTC thermistor from the Vishay NTCLE100E3 series with a beta value around 3950K.
   - Power dissipation in the thermistor should be kept under 100μW to limit self-heating to under 1%.

2. Buffer Amplifier:
   - Configuration: Non-inverting operational amplifier.
   - Op-Amp: TL081, LF356, or equivalent with high input impedance (>1 MΩ) and low output impedance (< 100Ω).
   - Power Supply: Assuming ±12V or ±15V, dual supply or a single supply if a rail-to-rail op-amp is used.
   - Bandwidth: 1 kHz or higher to capture the slow temperature fluctuations.
   - Noise: Low-noise Op-Amp like AD797 or OP-27.

3. Linearization Circuit:
   - A resistive bridge or an op-amp-based linearization circuit can be used.
   - Precision metal film resistors with a 1% tolerance should be used for stability.

4. Gain Stage:
   - Configuration: Non-inverting operational amplifier.
   - Op-Amp: AD8628, OPAx177, or similar precision operational amplifier.
   - Adjustable gain network with a precision potentiometer; initial gain setting assuming a 1 mA current through the thermistor and a voltage range of 0.5V to 2V for the temperatures of interest.
   - Gain: 13.33 (calculated as 20V output range divided by the 1.5V input range).

5. Low-pass Filter:
   - Topology: Sallen-Key or multiple feedback (MFB) second-order active filter.
   - Op-Amp: OPAx177, AD8605, or equivalent low-noise, precision op-amp.
   - Cutoff Frequency: 1 Hz, assuming slow temperature changes.
   - Component Values: Resistors at 10kΩ and capacitors calculated as C = 1 / (2π * 10kΩ * 1 Hz) ≈ 15.9 μF; rounded standard value to use is 15 μF or 16 μF.

6. Output Stage:
   - Topology: Non-Inverting Amplifier with rail-to-rail output capability if possible.
   - Gain: 10 (assuming a 2V maximum input from low-pass filter to achieve a 20V output).
   - Feedback Resistors: If Ri is 10kΩ, Rf should be 90kΩ.
   - Power Supply: ±12V or +24V for a single supply rail-to-rail op-amp.
   - Additional Features: Overvoltage and short-circuit protection where necessary.

Note: The design choices provided here are based on typical values and assumptions in the absence of specific details. The actual component values and configurations may require adjustments once the specific parameters of the thermistor and other system requirements are known.
