With these assumptions, the following is suggested:\n\n1. ADC Topology: A Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC is recommended due to its good balance between speed, power consumption, resolution, and cost.\n\n2. Resolution: We'll assume a standard resolution of 12 bits for the ADC, providing a good trade-off between resolution and cost. This will give us 4096 discrete levels for the +/- 7V input range, resulting in a voltage resolution of approximately 3.42 mV.\n\n3. Sampling Rate: Assuming a pendulum with a period on the order of seconds and desiring to capture a smooth waveform, a sampling rate of at least 100 samples per second (100 Hz) should be sufficient. However, to allow some margin, and considering the Nyquist criterion, a sampling rate of 1 kHz is recommended to capture higher-order harmonics that may be present in the signal.\n\n4. Communication Interface: Without a specific requirement, SPI or I2C are typical choices due to their widespread use and support by most microcontrollers. SPI is generally faster, while I2C uses fewer pins and supports multiple devices on the same bus.\n\n5. Accuracy: Without specific accuracy requirements, the inherent accuracy of a typical 12-bit SAR ADC (which usually has an INL and DNL of less than 1 LSB) should be adequate for most applications.\n\n6. Environmental Conditions: For general indoor environments, a commercial-grade ADC with a temperature range of 0°C to 70°C should suffice. For harsher environments, an industrial-grade ADC with a wider temperature range may be necessary.\n\n7. Anti-Aliasing Filter: An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency slightly below 500 Hz (half of the 1 kHz sampling rate) is recommended to prevent aliasing.\n\nThese recommendations are based on general assumptions and may need to be adjusted based on specific project requirements that were not provided.\n```",

An example model would be the Bourns 3540S series, which offers a rotational angle of up to 340 degrees and a linear taper for precise readings.\n\nThe potentiometer should have linearity within 0.5% to 1% for improved accuracy. The temperature coefficient should also be low, typically around 50 to 100 ppm/°C, to maintain stability across potential temperature variations.\n\nConsidering the pendulum angle range of 45 to 135 degrees with 90 degrees as the steady position, the potentiometer should be installed such that its wiper is at the midpoint of its track at the pendulum's steady position. This will ensure that the voltage output of the potentiometer is maximally linear with the pendulum's angular position.\n\nSince specific resolution and sensitivity requirements are not provided, a standard 10-turn potentiometer would suffice, allowing for finer resolution in the output voltage for a given angle, improving the accuracy of the angle determination.\n\nFor durability, a conductive plastic element potentiometer is recommended as it provides good resistance to wear and stable performance over time. If the pendulum system is prone to vibrations or mechanical stresses, the potentiometer should have a robust mechanical design to withstand these conditions.\n\nThe potentiometer should be rated for at least the available power supply voltage range of -10V to +10V. It's essential to ensure the potentiometer can handle any current it might be subjected to when connected to the power supply, but typical potentiometers have very low current requirements, so this should not be a concern.\n\nThe final selection of the potentiometer would also need to consider the physical mounting constraints and weight limitations implied by the wooden structure. However, as there are no specific constraints provided, a standard size potentiometer should be used, ensuring it can be easily mounted to the structure without impacting its mechanical integrity or the pendulum's motion.\n```",

This setup will ensure that the potentiometer's output voltage is not loaded by the subsequent stages, and the full voltage swing can be passed on without attenuation.\n\nFor the given potentiometer output range of -5V to 5V, the following buffer topology can be utilized:\n\n- Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) Selection: Choose a rail-to-rail input/output Op-Amp capable of operating from a single supply voltage that matches the power source range (-10V to +10V). The Op-Amp should have a high input impedance, low output impedance, and be capable of swinging to the rails to ensure the maximum output voltage range is utilized.\n\n- Configuration: A voltage follower (unity-gain buffer) will be used. This involves connecting the output of the Op-Amp back to its inverting input and the non-inverting input to the potentiometer's output.\n\nSuggested Op-Amp: Texas Instruments OPAx340 or Analog Devices AD8605, which meet the voltage range and rail-to-rail requirements. Ensure the chosen Op-Amp has a high input impedance, typically in the megaohms range, which will be adequate for buffering the signal from the potentiometer.\n\nNo external resistors or capacitors are required for the voltage follower configuration. However, a decoupling capacitor (0.1 µF ceramic capacitor) should be placed close to the Op-Amp's power supply pins to filter out any power supply noise.\n\nAs impedance, bandwidth, slew rate, and environmental specifications were not provided, standard components are suggested, assuming typical conditions for indoor laboratory equipment. If the operational environment is known to be harsh, consider Op-Amps that are specified for extended industrial or automotive temperature ranges and have additional protections against moisture or other environmental factors.\n\nIn the absence of specific information on the subsequent stages, the high input impedance of the Op-Amp buffer will be sufficient to drive most standard low-pass filter inputs without significant loading or signal degradation.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nLowPassFilter\n\nGiven the DAQ's sampling rate is 1000 samples per second, the Nyquist frequency is 500 Hz. To avoid aliasing, the anti-aliasing filter should have a cutoff frequency well below this, typically between 40 to 100 Hz, to ensure sufficient attenuation of signals above the Nyquist frequency.\n\nFor the fundamental 50 and 60 Hz noise attenuation, the filter should provide a significant damping at these frequencies. Without specific requirements on roll-off rate, stopband attenuation, and phase shift (points 2, 3, and 4), a reasonable starting point would be to use a 2nd-order (12 dB/octave roll-off) or 4th-order (24 dB/octave roll-off) low-pass filter which offers a good trade-off between complexity and performance. Given the lack of constraints on space, power, or thermal considerations (point 5), both active and passive filter topologies are viable.\n\nTwo common filter topologies are suitable:\n1. Sallen-Key topology for an active filter.\n2. Multiple Feedback (MFB) topology for an active filter.\n\nFor simplicity and ease of design, a 2nd-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of about 100 Hz can be implemented. This is a simple active filter topology that uses operational amplifiers, resistors, and capacitors. It provides adequate attenuation of 50 and 60 Hz noise while maintaining simplicity in design.\n\nSuggested component values for a 100 Hz 2nd-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter are:\n- Resistors: Two resistors of equal value, R = 1.59 kOhm.\n- Capacitors: Two capacitors of equal value, C = 1 uF.\n- Operational Amplifier: Any general-purpose op-amp that can operate within the power supply range and has a gain-bandwidth product greater than 1 MHz.\n\nIf a sharper cutoff is desired, a 4th-order filter can be cascaded from two 2nd-order sections. However, this increases complexity and may require more fine-tuning to ensure stability and desired performance.\n\nFinally, without specific requirements on allowable signal distortion or phase shift, the suggested 2nd-order filter strikes a balance between complexity and performance, suitable for many general applications. If the user finds these parameters critical, a Bessel topology might be recommended due to its flat phase response, at the cost of a less sharp roll-off.\n\nPlease note that the actual performance of the filter should be verified in the application and adjusted if necessary to meet specific needs.\n```",

However, if signal conditioning is required for any reason (for example, to match the DAQ's impedance or to filter noise without affecting the signal amplitude), a unity-gain buffer (voltage follower) using an operational amplifier could be implemented. This would maintain the signal level while providing a low impedance output to drive the DAQ input.\n\nIf adjustable gain is required in the future or if there are concerns about the exact output range of the potentiometer not matching the DAQ input range, a non-inverting amplifier configuration with a potentiometer in the feedback loop could be used to allow for gain adjustments.\n\nOtherwise, for a fixed gain, the non-inverting amplifier topology would be appropriate with a gain of 1 (Rf/Rin = 0, where Rf is the feedback resistor and Rin is the input resistor, effectively making it a unity-gain buffer).\n\nAn example of a suitable operational amplifier for the unity-gain buffer would be the TL071, which has a JFET input, providing high input impedance to prevent loading the potentiometer and a low output impedance to drive the DAQ system.\n\nFor precision requirements, a more precise op-amp like the AD precision series could be used, but given the lack of information on precision requirements, the TL071 would suffice for general purposes.\n\nThe anti-aliasing filter should have a cutoff frequency just under 500 Hz (half the sampling rate) to prevent aliasing, which could be achieved with a simple RC low-pass filter with carefully selected resistor and capacitor values.\n\nIf there are specific requirements for load impedance or if the DAQ system impedance is known to be low, an op-amp with higher current drive capability may be required, such as the LM324 or OPA series. However, without this information, the TL071 remains a reasonable default choice.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nANTI_ALIASING_FILTER\n\nGiven the provided sampling rate of the DAQ system is 1000 samples per second, the Nyquist frequency is 500 Hz. Therefore, the cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter should be less than 500 Hz to prevent aliasing. Here are some reasonable assumptions and suggestions based on common practices:\n\n- Maximum Frequency of Interest: Without explicit information on the pendulum's oscillation frequency, a reasonable assumption for a pendulum's natural frequency is likely to be much lower than the Nyquist frequency. Therefore, we might set a cutoff frequency at 100 Hz or lower to ensure we capture the pendulum's motion without including unnecessary high frequencies.\n\n- Stopband Attenuation and Passband Ripple: In the absence of specific requirements, we aim for a stopband attenuation of at least 60 dB to effectively attenuate unwanted signals like the 50 Hz and 60 Hz interference and a passband ripple of less than 0.1 dB to ensure minimal distortion of the pendulum's signal.\n\n- Filter Type: A Butterworth filter is commonly chosen for anti-aliasing purposes due to its flat passband, which ensures minimal signal distortion within the frequency range of interest. A Chebyshev or elliptic filter could be used if a sharper cutoff is needed and some passband ripple is acceptable.\n\n- Complexity: Without specific constraints, we will design a filter that balances performance with simplicity. A second-order (two-pole) Butterworth filter is often sufficient for many applications and offers a simple design.\n\nConsidering the above, here is a suggestion for the anti-aliasing filter:\n\n- Filter Topology: Active Second-Order Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency: 100 Hz\n- Passband Ripple: \u003c 0.1 dB\n- Stopband Attenuation: \u003e 60 dB beyond 500 Hz\n\nTypical component values for such a filter, assuming a standard operational amplifier and a supply voltage compatible with the rest of the system, might include:\n\n- Resistors: Two equal-value resistors (R), calculated based on the desired cutoff frequency and the chosen capacitor value.\n- Capacitors: Two equal-value capacitors (C), chosen in conjunction with resistors to set the cutoff frequency.\n- Op-Amp: A low-noise operational amplifier suitable for the power supply and frequency range.\n\nThe precise resistor (R) and capacitor (C) values can be determined using the standard formula for a Butterworth filter's cutoff frequency, fc:\n\n$$ fc = \\frac{1}{2\\pi RC} $$\n\nChoosing standard capacitor values, we can then calculate the required resistor values for the desired 100 Hz cutoff. For example, with 0.01 µF capacitors, the resistor value would be approximately:\n\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\times 100 \\text{Hz} \\times 0.01 \\text{µF}} \\approx 159.15 \\text{kΩ} $$\n\nTo achieve the desired attenuation and ripple specifications, additional filter stages can be cascaded if required.\n```",

Potentiometer: Acts as a variable resistor, converting the angular position of the pendulum into a corresponding voltage signal. Its resistance changes linearly with the angle of the pendulum.\n\n2. Buffer: Provides impedance matching between the potentiometer and subsequent stages. It ensures that the potentiometer’s output voltage does not drop significantly when connected to the next stage due to input impedance. A unity-gain buffer (voltage follower) is typically used here.\n\n3. Low-Pass Filter: Attenuates unwanted high-frequency noise, including 50 and 60 Hz from electrical sources. This is important to ensure the signal representing the pendulum's angle is as clean as possible before amplification and digitization.\n\n4. Gain Stage: Amplifies the signal to match the input range of the DAQ system. This block will scale the voltage from the potentiometer to fit within the +/- 7V range of the DAQ. The gain must be carefully set to avoid clipping while using the full dynamic range of the DAQ.\n\n5. Anti-Aliasing Filter: A low-pass filter placed before the DAQ to remove frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency, thus preventing aliasing when the analog signal is converted to digital. This filter should have a cutoff frequency just below half of the DAQ's sampling rate.\n\n6. DAQ (Data Acquisition System): The final block in the signal path. It samples the conditioned analog signal and converts it to a digital format for further processing or display. It is not part of the signal conditioning but is the endpoint of the signal path in this context.\n```",

With these assumptions, the following is suggested:\n\n1. ADC Topology: A Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC is recommended due to its good balance between speed, power consumption, resolution, and cost.\n\n2. Resolution: We'll assume a standard resolution of 12 bits for the ADC, providing a good trade-off between resolution and cost. This will give us 4096 discrete levels for the +/- 7V input range, resulting in a voltage resolution of approximately 3.42 mV.\n\n3. Sampling Rate: Assuming a pendulum with a period on the order of seconds and desiring to capture a smooth waveform, a sampling rate of at least 100 samples per second (100 Hz) should be sufficient. However, to allow some margin, and considering the Nyquist criterion, a sampling rate of 1 kHz is recommended to capture higher-order harmonics that may be present in the signal.\n\n4. Communication Interface: Without a specific requirement, SPI or I2C are typical choices due to their widespread use and support by most microcontrollers. SPI is generally faster, while I2C uses fewer pins and supports multiple devices on the same bus.\n\n5. Accuracy: Without specific accuracy requirements, the inherent accuracy of a typical 12-bit SAR ADC (which usually has an INL and DNL of less than 1 LSB) should be adequate for most applications.\n\n6. Environmental Conditions: For general indoor environments, a commercial-grade ADC with a temperature range of 0°C to 70°C should suffice. For harsher environments, an industrial-grade ADC with a wider temperature range may be necessary.\n\n7. Anti-Aliasing Filter: An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency slightly below 500 Hz (half of the 1 kHz sampling rate) is recommended to prevent aliasing.\n\nThese recommendations are based on general assumptions and may need to be adjusted based on specific project requirements that were not provided.\n```",

The temperature coefficient should also be low, typically around 50 to 100 ppm/°C, to maintain stability across potential temperature variations.\n\nConsidering the pendulum angle range of 45 to 135 degrees with 90 degrees as the steady position, the potentiometer should be installed such that its wiper is at the midpoint of its track at the pendulum's steady position. This will ensure that the voltage output of the potentiometer is maximally linear with the pendulum's angular position.\n\nSince specific resolution and sensitivity requirements are not provided, a standard 10-turn potentiometer would suffice, allowing for finer resolution in the output voltage for a given angle, improving the accuracy of the angle determination.\n\nFor durability, a conductive plastic element potentiometer is recommended as it provides good resistance to wear and stable performance over time. If the pendulum system is prone to vibrations or mechanical stresses, the potentiometer should have a robust mechanical design to withstand these conditions.\n\nThe potentiometer should be rated for at least the available power supply voltage range of -10V to +10V. It's essential to ensure the potentiometer can handle any current it might be subjected to when connected to the power supply, but typical potentiometers have very low current requirements, so this should not be a concern.\n\nThe final selection of the potentiometer would also need to consider the physical mounting constraints and weight limitations implied by the wooden structure.

Ensure the chosen Op-Amp has a high input impedance, typically in the megaohms range, which will be adequate for buffering the signal from the potentiometer.\n\nNo external resistors or capacitors are required for the voltage follower configuration.

To avoid aliasing, the anti-aliasing filter should have a cutoff frequency well below this, typically between 40 to 100 Hz, to ensure sufficient attenuation of signals above the Nyquist frequency.\n\nFor the fundamental 50 and 60 Hz noise attenuation, the filter should provide a significant damping at these frequencies. Without specific requirements on roll-off rate, stopband attenuation, and phase shift (points 2, 3, and 4), a reasonable starting point would be to use a 2nd-order (12 dB/octave roll-off) or 4th-order (24 dB/octave roll-off) low-pass filter which offers a good trade-off between complexity and performance. Given the lack of constraints on space, power, or thermal considerations (point 5), both active and passive filter topologies are viable.\n\nTwo common filter topologies are suitable:\n1. Sallen-Key topology for an active filter.\n2. Multiple Feedback (MFB) topology for an active filter.\n\nFor simplicity and ease of design, a 2nd-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of about 100 Hz can be implemented. This is a simple active filter topology that uses operational amplifiers, resistors, and capacitors. It provides adequate attenuation of 50 and 60 Hz noise while maintaining simplicity in design.\n\nSuggested component values for a 100 Hz 2nd-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter are:\n- Resistors: Two resistors of equal value, R = 1.59 kOhm.\n- Capacitors: Two capacitors of equal value, C = 1 uF.\n- Operational Amplifier: Any general-purpose op-amp that can operate within the power supply range and has a gain-bandwidth product greater than 1 MHz.\n\nIf a sharper cutoff is desired, a 4th-order filter can be cascaded from two 2nd-order sections. However, this increases complexity and may require more fine-tuning to ensure stability and desired performance.\n\nFinally, without specific requirements on allowable signal distortion or phase shift, the suggested 2nd-order filter strikes a balance between complexity and performance, suitable for many general applications. If the user finds these parameters critical, a Bessel topology might be recommended due to its flat phase response, at the cost of a less sharp roll-off.\n\nPlease note that the actual performance of the filter should be verified in the application and adjusted if necessary to meet specific needs.\n```",

Therefore, the cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter should be less than 500 Hz to prevent aliasing. Here are some reasonable assumptions and suggestions based on common practices:\n\n- Maximum Frequency of Interest: Without explicit information on the pendulum's oscillation frequency, a reasonable assumption for a pendulum's natural frequency is likely to be much lower than the Nyquist frequency. Therefore, we might set a cutoff frequency at 100 Hz or lower to ensure we capture the pendulum's motion without including unnecessary high frequencies.\n\n- Stopband Attenuation and Passband Ripple: In the absence of specific requirements, we aim for a stopband attenuation of at least 60 dB to effectively attenuate unwanted signals like the 50 Hz and 60 Hz interference and a passband ripple of less than 0.1 dB to ensure minimal distortion of the pendulum's signal.\n\n- Filter Type: A Butterworth filter is commonly chosen for anti-aliasing purposes due to its flat passband, which ensures minimal signal distortion within the frequency range of interest. A Chebyshev or elliptic filter could be used if a sharper cutoff is needed and some passband ripple is acceptable.\n\n- Complexity: Without specific constraints, we will design a filter that balances performance with simplicity. A second-order (two-pole) Butterworth filter is often sufficient for many applications and offers a simple design.\n\nConsidering the above, here is a suggestion for the anti-aliasing filter:\n\n- Filter Topology: Active Second-Order Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency: 100 Hz\n- Passband Ripple: \u003c 0.1 dB\n- Stopband Attenuation: \u003e 60 dB beyond 500 Hz\n\nTypical component values for such a filter, assuming a standard operational amplifier and a supply voltage compatible with the rest of the system, might include:\n\n- Resistors: Two equal-value resistors (R), calculated based on the desired cutoff frequency and the chosen capacitor value.\n- Capacitors: Two equal-value capacitors (C), chosen in conjunction with resistors to set the cutoff frequency.\n- Op-Amp: A low-noise operational amplifier suitable for the power supply and frequency range.\n\nThe precise resistor (R) and capacitor (C) values can be determined using the standard formula for a Butterworth filter's cutoff frequency, fc:\n\n$$ fc = \\frac{1}{2\\pi RC} $$\n\nChoosing standard capacitor values, we can then calculate the required resistor values for the desired 100 Hz cutoff. For example, with 0.01 µF capacitors, the resistor value would be approximately:\n\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\times 100 \\text{Hz} \\times 0.01 \\text{µF}} \\approx 159.15 \\text{kΩ} $$\n\nTo achieve the desired attenuation and ripple specifications, additional filter stages can be cascaded if required.\n```",

Potentiometer: Acts as a variable resistor, converting the angular position of the pendulum into a corresponding voltage signal. Its resistance changes linearly with the angle of the pendulum.\n\n2. Buffer: Provides impedance matching between the potentiometer and subsequent stages. It ensures that the potentiometer’s output voltage does not drop significantly when connected to the next stage due to input impedance. A unity-gain buffer (voltage follower) is typically used here.\n\n3. Low-Pass Filter: Attenuates unwanted high-frequency noise, including 50 and 60 Hz from electrical sources. This is important to ensure the signal representing the pendulum's angle is as clean as possible before amplification and digitization.\n\n4. Gain Stage: Amplifies the signal to match the input range of the DAQ system. This block will scale the voltage from the potentiometer to fit within the +/- 7V range of the DAQ. The gain must be carefully set to avoid clipping while using the full dynamic range of the DAQ.\n\n5. Anti-Aliasing Filter: A low-pass filter placed before the DAQ to remove frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency, thus preventing aliasing when the analog signal is converted to digital. This filter should have a cutoff frequency just below half of the DAQ's sampling rate.\n\n6. DAQ (Data Acquisition System): The final block in the signal path. It samples the conditioned analog signal and converts it to a digital format for further processing or display. It is not part of the signal conditioning but is the endpoint of the signal path in this context.\n```"

With these assumptions, the following is suggested:\n\n1. ADC Topology: A Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC is recommended due to its good balance between speed, power consumption, resolution, and cost.\n\n2. Resolution: We'll assume a standard resolution of 12 bits for the ADC, providing a good trade-off between resolution and cost. This will give us 4096 discrete levels for the +/- 7V input range, resulting in a voltage resolution of approximately 3.42 mV.\n\n3. Sampling Rate: Assuming a pendulum with a period on the order of seconds and desiring to capture a smooth waveform, a sampling rate of at least 100 samples per second (100 Hz) should be sufficient. However, to allow some margin, and considering the Nyquist criterion, a sampling rate of 1 kHz is recommended to capture higher-order harmonics that may be present in the signal.\n\n4. Communication Interface: Without a specific requirement, SPI or I2C are typical choices due to their widespread use and support by most microcontrollers. SPI is generally faster, while I2C uses fewer pins and supports multiple devices on the same bus.\n\n5. Accuracy: Without specific accuracy requirements, the inherent accuracy of a typical 12-bit SAR ADC (which usually has an INL and DNL of less than 1 LSB) should be adequate for most applications.\n\n6. Environmental Conditions: For general indoor environments, a commercial-grade ADC with a temperature range of 0°C to 70°C should suffice. For harsher environments, an industrial-grade ADC with a wider temperature range may be necessary.\n\n7. Anti-Aliasing Filter: An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency slightly below 500 Hz (half of the 1 kHz sampling rate) is recommended to prevent aliasing.\n\nThese recommendations are based on general assumptions and may need to be adjusted based on specific project requirements that were not provided.\n```"

An example model would be the Bourns 3540S series, which offers a rotational angle of up to 340 degrees and a linear taper for precise readings.\n\nThe potentiometer should have linearity within 0.5% to 1% for improved accuracy. The temperature coefficient should also be low, typically around 50 to 100 ppm/°C, to maintain stability across potential temperature variations.\n\nConsidering the pendulum angle range of 45 to 135 degrees with 90 degrees as the steady position, the potentiometer should be installed such that its wiper is at the midpoint of its track at the pendulum's steady position. This will ensure that the voltage output of the potentiometer is maximally linear with the pendulum's angular position.\n\nSince specific resolution and sensitivity requirements are not provided, a standard 10-turn potentiometer would suffice, allowing for finer resolution in the output voltage for a given angle, improving the accuracy of the angle determination.\n\nFor durability, a conductive plastic element potentiometer is recommended as it provides good resistance to wear and stable performance over time. If the pendulum system is prone to vibrations or mechanical stresses, the potentiometer should have a robust mechanical design to withstand these conditions.\n\nThe potentiometer should be rated for at least the available power supply voltage range of -10V to +10V. It's essential to ensure the potentiometer can handle any current it might be subjected to when connected to the power supply, but typical potentiometers have very low current requirements, so this should not be a concern.\n\nThe final selection of the potentiometer would also need to consider the physical mounting constraints and weight limitations implied by the wooden structure. However, as there are no specific constraints provided, a standard size potentiometer should be used, ensuring it can be easily mounted to the structure without impacting its mechanical integrity or the pendulum's motion.\n```"

Without specific requirements on roll-off rate, stopband attenuation, and phase shift (points 2, 3, and 4), a reasonable starting point would be to use a 2nd-order (12 dB/octave roll-off) or 4th-order (24 dB/octave roll-off) low-pass filter which offers a good trade-off between complexity and performance. Given the lack of constraints on space, power, or thermal considerations (point 5), both active and passive filter topologies are viable.\n\nTwo common filter topologies are suitable:\n1.

Multiple Feedback (MFB) topology for an active filter.\n\nFor simplicity and ease of design, a 2nd-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of about 100 Hz can be implemented. This is a simple active filter topology that uses operational amplifiers, resistors, and capacitors. It provides adequate attenuation of 50 and 60 Hz noise while maintaining simplicity in design.\n\nSuggested component values for a 100 Hz 2nd-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter are:\n- Resistors: Two resistors of equal value, R = 1.59 kOhm.\n- Capacitors: Two capacitors of equal value, C = 1 uF.\n- Operational Amplifier: Any general-purpose op-amp that can operate within the power supply range and has a gain-bandwidth product greater than 1 MHz.\n\nIf a sharper cutoff is desired, a 4th-order filter can be cascaded from two 2nd-order sections. However, this increases complexity and may require more fine-tuning to ensure stability and desired performance.\n\nFinally, without specific requirements on allowable signal distortion or phase shift, the suggested 2nd-order filter strikes a balance between complexity and performance, suitable for many general applications. If the user finds these parameters critical, a Bessel topology might be recommended due to its flat phase response, at the cost of a less sharp roll-off.\n\nPlease note that the actual performance of the filter should be verified in the application and adjusted if necessary to meet specific needs.\n```"

Therefore, the cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter should be less than 500 Hz to prevent aliasing. Here are some reasonable assumptions and suggestions based on common practices:\n\n- Maximum Frequency of Interest: Without explicit information on the pendulum's oscillation frequency, a reasonable assumption for a pendulum's natural frequency is likely to be much lower than the Nyquist frequency. Therefore, we might set a cutoff frequency at 100 Hz or lower to ensure we capture the pendulum's motion without including unnecessary high frequencies.\n\n- Stopband Attenuation and Passband Ripple: In the absence of specific requirements, we aim for a stopband attenuation of at least 60 dB to effectively attenuate unwanted signals like the 50 Hz and 60 Hz interference and a passband ripple of less than 0.1 dB to ensure minimal distortion of the pendulum's signal.\n\n- Filter Type: A Butterworth filter is commonly chosen for anti-aliasing purposes due to its flat passband, which ensures minimal signal distortion within the frequency range of interest. A Chebyshev or elliptic filter could be used if a sharper cutoff is needed and some passband ripple is acceptable.\n\n- Complexity: Without specific constraints, we will design a filter that balances performance with simplicity. A second-order (two-pole) Butterworth filter is often sufficient for many applications and offers a simple design.\n\nConsidering the above, here is a suggestion for the anti-aliasing filter:\n\n- Filter Topology: Active Second-Order Butterworth Low-Pass Filter\n- Cutoff Frequency: 100 Hz\n- Passband Ripple: \u003c 0.1 dB\n- Stopband Attenuation: \u003e 60 dB beyond 500 Hz\n\nTypical component values for such a filter, assuming a standard operational amplifier and a supply voltage compatible with the rest of the system, might include:\n\n- Resistors: Two equal-value resistors (R), calculated based on the desired cutoff frequency and the chosen capacitor value.\n- Capacitors: Two equal-value capacitors (C), chosen in conjunction with resistors to set the cutoff frequency.\n- Op-Amp: A low-noise operational amplifier suitable for the power supply and frequency range.\n\nThe precise resistor (R) and capacitor (C) values can be determined using the standard formula for a Butterworth filter's cutoff frequency, fc:\n\n$$ fc = \\frac{1}{2\\pi RC} $$\n\nChoosing standard capacitor values, we can then calculate the required resistor values for the desired 100 Hz cutoff. For example, with 0.01 µF capacitors, the resistor value would be approximately:\n\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\times 100 \\text{Hz} \\times 0.01 \\text{µF}} \\approx 159.15 \\text{kΩ} $$\n\nTo achieve the desired attenuation and ripple specifications, additional filter stages can be cascaded if required.\n```"
