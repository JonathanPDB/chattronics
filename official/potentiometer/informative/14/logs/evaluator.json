        "content": "Pendulum Angle Measurement System Design\n\n**Potentiometer Selection**\n- Type: Linear potentiometer, suitable for mapping the pendulum's 45 to 135 degrees range of motion.\n- Suggested Model: Bourns PTA series, PTA4543-2015DP-A103 or equivalent, with 10 kOhm resistance.\n- Expected Power Source: -10V to +10V with a corresponding output voltage range.\n- Implementation: Mechanical linkage is required to ensure the potentiometer's travel correlates with the pendulum's angular range.\n\n**Buffer Stage**\n- Function: Isolation of potentiometer from downstream loading and gain adjustment.\n- Design: Non-inverting operational amplifier configuration.\n- Gain Setting: A gain of 0.7 is needed to scale down the potentiometer's -10V to +10V output to match the DAQ's +/-7V input range.\n- Resistor Values: Based on the gain formula (Av = 1 + (R2/R1)), choose R1 = 10kΩ and R2 = 3kΩ.\n- Op-amp Model: Precision op-amps like AD8628 or OPA2277, which have low offset voltage and low noise.\n- Bandwidth: At least 1kHz to capture the pendulum's motion without aliasing.\n\n**Low-Pass Filter**\n- Purpose: Removal of high-frequency noise and prevention of aliasing.\n- Cutoff Frequency: Between 150 Hz and 200 Hz to ensure capturing the pendulum motion.\n- Filter Order: First-order or second-order Butterworth filter for flat passband or second-order Bessel filter for linear phase characteristics.\n- Topology: Active filter using operational amplifiers for better performance and control.\n\n**Notch Filter**\n- Function: Attenuation of 50 Hz and 60 Hz power line noise.\n- Depth of Attenuation: Aim for at least 20 dB at notch frequencies.\n- Filter Order: First-order Twin-T notch filter for each frequency. Consider higher-order active designs for deeper notches if needed.\n- Resistor and Capacitor Values: For a 50 Hz notch, R = 10 kΩ and C = 318.3 nF; for a 60 Hz notch, R = 10 kΩ and C = 265.3 nF. These values should be fine-tuned.\n\n**Data Acquisition (DAQ) System**\n- ADC Type: Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC for its balance between speed, accuracy, and cost.\n- Resolution: A 12-bit resolution to offer a voltage resolution of approximately 3.42 mV per bit across the ±7 V input range.\n- Sampling Rate: 1000 samples per second, with capability slightly higher than the minimum requirement.\n- Input Impedance: High, to prevent loading effects on the signal conditioning circuitry.\n- Anti-Aliasing Filter: Required before the ADC with a cutoff below 500 Hz (Nyquist frequency).\n\n**Overall Considerations**\n- The potentiometer's mechanical linkage, buffer stage gain, low-pass filter cutoff, and notch filter values need to be tested and possibly adjusted during prototyping.\n- Component choices should focus on stability and precision to ensure the reliability of angle measurements.\n- The system must be validated to ensure that the analog signal accurately represents the pendulum's angle and that noise is sufficiently filtered before analog-to-digital conversion."

    "response": "```explanations\n1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider: The selection of a linear potentiometer and its implementation suggests that it is indeed being used as a voltage divider. (Reached)\n2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V: The expected power source is stated to be -10V to +10V, which fulfills this requirement. (Reached)\n3. The architecture is simple: The description outlines a simple architecture consisting of a potentiometer, a buffer stage (voltage buffer), a low-pass filter, and a notch filter, followed by the DAQ system. (Reached)\n4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered in 0, for example, +/- 7V: The buffer stage is designed with a gain of 0.7 to scale the potentiometer output to match the DAQ's input range of +/- 7V. (Reached)\n5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V: The buffer stage gain ensures the maximum voltage to the DAQ is 7V, which is critical as stated. (Reached)\n6. There is a low pass filter (or anti-aliasing filter) that avoids aliasing: A low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency between 150 Hz and 200 Hz is included to remove high-frequency noise and prevent aliasing. (Reached)\n7. There is a filter removing frequencies between around 50 and 60 Hz: A notch filter is specifically mentioned to attenuate 50 Hz and 60 Hz power line noise. (Reached)\n8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz: Although the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter is mentioned to be between 150 Hz and 200 Hz, there is no explicit information about the gain of the signal at 500 Hz. However, a first-order filter typically has a slope of -20 dB/decade, and a second-order filter has -40 dB/decade. Given the cutoff is around 150-200 Hz, the 500 Hz point is within the first decade above the cutoff frequency, and thus the filter would not meet a -20 dB gain reduction by 500 Hz. This requirement is not reached.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n7\n```",
