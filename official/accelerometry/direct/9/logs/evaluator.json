    "response": "```explanations\n1. The feedback resistance (Rf) is approximately 127 Megaohms, and the feedback capacitance (Cf) is 5 pF. The product of Rf and Cf should be close to 2/pi, which is approximately 0.637. However, 127MΩ * 5pF = 635pF, which is very close to the desired value. This meets the requirement within the allowed 10% difference.\n\n2. The charge amplifier gain (Av) is not explicitly given, but we can deduce it from the desired output. Since the desired output is 1 V peak-to-peak and the maximum charge (Qmax) is 5 pC, we use the formula Vout = Q/Cf to find the gain. With a Cf of 5 pF, the gain needed to achieve 1 V output from 5 pC is 200. However, to meet the requirement of G x 1.61p / Cf being roughly around 1, the gain (G) should be such that when multiplied by 1.61E-12 and then divided by 5E-12 (Cf), the result is approximately 1. Here, 200 x 1.61E-12 / 5E-12 = 64.4, which does not meet the requirement.\n\n3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated as 5 pC, based on the assumed peak acceleration of 0.05 g and the sensitivity of 100 pC/g. This is not close to the required 161 pC, so this requirement is not met.\n\n4. There is no explicit mention of the bias current being provided, so this requirement is not met.\n\n5. The relationship between the feedback resistance and the bias current is not provided, so this requirement is not met.\n\n6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which meets this requirement.\n\n7. The project is optimized for low-frequency vibration measurement, but there is no explicit mention of an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, nor calculations to back it up. Therefore, this requirement is not met.\n\n8. The desired output voltage is 1 V peak-to-peak, which meets this requirement.\n\n9. There is a goal to minimize offset, but there is no quantitative value given to confirm that it is kept below 10 mV. Therefore, this requirement is not met.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n3\n```",
