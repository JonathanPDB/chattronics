Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary describes a pendulum angle measurement system that uses a potentiometer for sensing, followed by signal conditioning before acquisition by a DAQ system. Here's a breakdown of how the requirements are addressed:

1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider: The project uses a precision potentiometer to generate a voltage proportional to the pendulum's angle, which meets the requirement of using a potentiometer as a voltage divider.

2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V: The summary does not explicitly state the voltage applied to the potentiometer, but it implies that the potentiometer's voltage range is -10V to +10V. This suggests that the requirement is met.

3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, buffer, low-pass filter, and notch filter before the DAQ: The project incorporates all these elements, fulfilling the architecture requirement.

4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, for example, +/- 7V: The voltage divider is designed to scale down the voltage to within the DAQ's range of +/- 7V, which meets the requirement.

5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V: The voltage divider and level shifter are meant to ensure that the signal does not exceed +/- 7V, which is crucial.

6. The presence of a low-pass filter to avoid aliasing: The system includes a second-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz, which should prevent aliasing given the sampling rate is at least 2000 samples per second.

7. A filter removing frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz is present: Notch filters are specified to attenuate frequencies at 50 Hz and 60 Hz, meeting this requirement.

8. The filter's gain is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz: Although the low-pass filter is specified with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz, the notch filters are designed to attenuate signals by more than 20 dB at 50 Hz and 60 Hz. However, the summary does not provide information on the filter's performance at 500 Hz, which is essential for determining if the requirement is met.

Given the information, there is a lack of clarity regarding the filter's performance at 500 Hz, which is a key requirement. Without this information, it's uncertain if the requirement for the filter's gain at 500 Hz is satisfied.
