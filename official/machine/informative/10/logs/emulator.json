Since the pressure sensors have a maximum output of 1 mV and temperature sensors have a maximum output of 100 mV, both may require amplification to match the input range of the ADC. Given that signal frequencies up to 400 Hz are expected, and frequencies higher than 400 Hz need not be recorded, a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency at or slightly above 400 Hz should be used to avoid aliasing. Additionally, temperature sensors have a nonlinear scale, which may require nonlinear signal conditioning or software compensation.\n```",
