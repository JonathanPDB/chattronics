Analog Temperature Measurement System Architecture

The Analog Temperature Measurement System is designed to measure the temperature of water inside a beaker using a thermistor and output a voltage that can be measured by a multimeter. The system spans across multiple blocks: Thermistor, Signal Conditioning, Temperature Compensation, and Voltage Output.

**Thermistor**
- Type and Model: Vishay NTCLE100E3, an NTC thermistor suitable for the 10-90°C temperature range.

**Signal Conditioning**
- Voltage Divider: Incorporates the thermistor and a precision fixed resistor to convert temperature-induced resistance changes into a voltage signal.
- Amplification: Utilizes an operational amplifier in a non-inverting configuration to amplify the voltage signal to the 0-20V range, ensuring compatibility with a multimeter's measurement range.
- Gain Calculation:
  Assuming a supply voltage (Vcc) of 24V and a temperature range of 10-90°C, the thermistor's resistance might change from approximately 30kΩ at 10°C to 1.2kΩ at 90°C. The voltage output at these extremes can be estimated as follows:
  \[ Vout_{min} \approx \frac{1.2kΩ}{1.2kΩ + 10kΩ} \times 24V \approx 2.4V \]
  \[ Vout_{max} \approx \frac{30kΩ}{30kΩ + 10kΩ} \times 24V \approx 18V \]
  The required gain for the amplifier is approximately:
  \[ G = \frac{20V}{18V - 2.4V} \approx 1.25 \]
  If R1 = 10kΩ, then R2 (nearest standard value) = 2.2kΩ for a gain of approximately 1.22.

**Temperature Compensation**
- Voltage Divider: Adjusted with a fixed resistor chosen to provide a linear voltage output relative to the temperature change. The resistance of the fixed resistor is chosen to match that of the thermistor at the midpoint of the temperature range.
- Calculations for the resistance values and compensation network would require the exact parameters from the thermistor's datasheet.

**Voltage Output**
- Low Output Impedance: Ensured by the operational amplifier's characteristics.
- Low-Pass Filter: Implemented to stabilize voltage reading and reduce noise. For example, with a 10kΩ resistor and a 1µF capacitor:
  \[ f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C} \approx 15.92Hz \]
- Calibration: Adjust the output voltage to correspond linearly with the thermistor's temperature readings.

**Measurements**
- Use a digital multimeter with a high impedance and capable of measuring up to 20V.
- Calibration and resolution of the multimeter should meet the temperature resolution requirements.
- All power supplied to the circuits should be stable and noise-free.

The system provides a linear voltage output between 0 and 20 volts corresponding to the water temperature between 10 and 90 degrees Celsius.
