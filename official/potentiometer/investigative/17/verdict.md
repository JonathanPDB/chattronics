Verdict: generic

Explanations: 
The project summary provided outlines a pendulum angle measurement system with various stages, including a potentiometer block, buffer, gain block (attenuation stage), level shifter, anti-aliasing filter, and DAQ interface. Here's an analysis based on the requirements:

1. The potentiometer is indeed used as a voltage divider, which satisfies requirement 1.
2. The voltage rating of the potentiometer is greater than +/-10V, which is good, satisfying requirement 2.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, buffer, and anti-aliasing filter before the DAQ, meeting requirement 3.
4. The mention of a level shifter suggests that the input voltage of the DAQ can be centered at 0, but the specific range of +/- 7V is not explicitly confirmed, so requirement 4 is not clearly met.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is not explicitly stated to be limited to 7V. While there are gain stages and level shifting, without clear information about the final output to the DAQ, requirement 5 cannot be confirmed.
6. There is an anti-aliasing filter specified, which should prevent aliasing, meeting requirement 6.
7. The summary does not mention a specific filter for removing frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which is a common requirement to eliminate power line interference. As such, requirement 7 is not met.
8. The cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing filter is specified at 250 Hz, but without knowing the order of the filter or the actual gain at 500 Hz, it is uncertain if the requirement of at least -20 dB gain at 500 Hz is met.

Given these points, the project summary does not fully satisfy all the essential requirements, particularly requirements 4, 5, and 7. Requirement 8 is also ambiguous without further details. Therefore, the project cannot be considered "optimal" or "acceptable." The information provided is not conceptually wrong, but it lacks the necessary details to ensure all requirements are met, and it is not unfeasible. Thus, the project falls into the "generic" category, as it is theoretically correct and can be implemented but is too generic without the specific details needed to assess the system fully.
