    "response": "```explanations\nThe project review for the analog electronics design of a pressure and temperature monitoring system has yielded the following findings:\n\n1. Both sensors are specified to have d.c. output, fulfilling the requirement of no demodulation.\n2. Amplification is clearly addressed for both the pressure and temperature sensors with detailed gain requirements and suggested amplifier topologies.\n3. While the pressure sensor is specified, the use of a Wheatstone bridge is not mentioned, nor is there mention of an instrumentation amplifier specifically for the pressure sensor.\n4. An ADC is incorporated into the design with a specified sampling rate and resolution.\n5. Linearization of the infrared temperature sensors is addressed through a microcontroller-based lookup table, which is an acceptable method.\n6. The solution does not explicitly mention the sampling order strategy (sequential, simultaneous, etc.).\n7. The specified sampling frequency of the ADC is 2 kHz per channel, which is above the minimum requirement of 800 Hz.\n8. The anti-aliasing filter is mentioned with a cutoff frequency set to 500 Hz for pressure and 450 Hz for temperature signals, but there is no explicit mention of the gain of the signal at half the sampling frequency.\n9. The low pass cutoff frequencies for both pressure and temperature signals are above 400 Hz and below the total sampling frequency, meeting the requirement.\n10. Low-pass filters are included in the design and are positioned appropriately before the multiplexer(s).\n11. A multiplexer is used in the system, fulfilling the requirement.\n12. The selected multiplexer is a solid-state device.\n\nBased on the above points, the design mostly adheres to the requirements. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed:\n\n- The use of a Wheatstone bridge and an instrumentation amplifier for the pressure sensor is not explicitly stated.\n- The sampling order strategy is not mentioned.\n- The anti-aliasing filter's performance at half the sampling frequency is not specified.\n\nDue to these shortcomings, the design cannot be classified as optimal. However, since the issues do not prevent the project from being implemented and do not constitute fatal flaws, the project is deemed acceptable.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```verdict\nacceptable\n```",
