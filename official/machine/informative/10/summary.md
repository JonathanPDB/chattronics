Analog Instrumentation System for Pressure and Temperature Monitoring

OVERVIEW:
The system is designed to monitor pressure and surface temperature variations at eight points of a machine. The analog sensor data is conditioned and digitized for analysis by a computer. Each sensor type has dedicated signal conditioning and analog-to-digital conversion stages before interfacing with a microcontroller.

PRESSURE MONITORING:
Pressure Sensor Array:
- Piezoresistive strain gauge pressure transducer
- Range: 0-10 bar (assumed for typical industrial applications)
- Output: 1 mV (at maximum pressure)
- Operating Temperature Range: -40 to 125째C

Instrumentation Amplifier (Pressure):
- Gain: 4500 to 5000x (depending on the ADC input range)
- Bandwidth: >1 kHz
- Topology: Three-op-amp instrumentation amplifier
- Power Supply: Single 5V supply with mid-supply biasing for the sensors
- Low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz (to remove frequencies above interest)

ADC (Pressure):
- Resolution: 12-bit recommended (to preserve 1% accuracy)
- Sampling Rate: At least 2 kHz (Nyquist criterion)
- Input Configuration: Differential preferred (for noise rejection)

TEMPERATURE MONITORING:
Temperature Sensor Array:
- Infrared radiation detector model MLX90614 (or equivalent IR thermometer sensor module)
- Measurement Range: -40째C to +85째C (typical for industrial applications)
- Output: 0 to 100 mV
- Resolution: 0.02째C (sensor intrinsic resolution)
- Response Time: ~37.5ms

Amplifier (Temperature):
- Gain: Approximately 1 to 2 (to match ADC input range without amplification)
- Filter: First-order or higher low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz
- Op-Amp: Low-noise, high-precision (e.g., Analog Devices AD8605)

ADC (Temperature):
- Resolution: 12-bit or higher
- Sampling Rate: 1 kHz to 10 kHz (considering transient events)
- Input Range: 0 to 100 mV (matched with sensor output)

MICROCONTROLLER:
- Selected for multiple communication interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C, Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
- Capable of handling high data throughput
- Real-time processing capabilities if required
- Power-saving modes and wide voltage supply ranges
- Compliance with industry standards if necessary
- Software: Potential use of an RTOS (e.g., FreeRTOS)

Note: All electronic components such as resistors and capacitors should be selected with tolerance levels that support the 1% accuracy requirement of the system (e.g., 1% tolerance for resistors and 5% for capacitors). Operational amplifiers should have a bandwidth at least five times higher than the filter cutoff frequency to ensure their performance does not limit the system.

This summary provides the high-level architecture and key specifications for the pressure and temperature monitoring system. Component selection and final design considerations should be verified based on the specific application and environmental conditions.
