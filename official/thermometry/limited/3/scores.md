Score: 8
Explanations: 
1. The output is being measured by a multimeter: The summary indicates that the output voltage can be measured by an external multimeter, fulfilling this requirement.
2. Amplification stage and gain justification: The project includes an instrumentation amplifier with a gain of 20 to amplify a 1V input to a 20V output, and a voltage output stage with a gain of 21 to account for component tolerances. The gain is provided and justified as necessary to reach the output voltage range.
3. Output voltage range between 0 and 20 Volts: The amplification stage is designed to provide a maximum output of 20V, meeting this requirement.
4. NTC is linearized by a resistor optimized for the midrange 50°C: The project specifies a 5kΩ precision resistor for linearization, calculated based on the NTC's resistance at different temperatures, indicating that the NTC is linearized for the midrange.
5. NTC is linearized: This is explicitly stated and a linearization method is described, satisfying this requirement.
6. Architecture: The project's architecture consists of the sensor (NTC), a linearization stage, amplification, optional filtering, and measurement, which aligns with the required architecture.
7. Sensor used is an NTC: The project uses a Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor, meeting this requirement.
8. Self-heating effect is taken into account: The maximum current through the NTC is limited to 100 µA to minimize self-heating, and the effect is kept below 1%, fulfilling this requirement.
