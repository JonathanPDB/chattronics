The charge amplifier gain multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (G x 1.61p / Cf) should be roughly around 1 (you can allow up to 10% difference from this value)\n3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC\n4. The bias current must be provided\n5. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current\n6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor\n7. The project is optimised for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude and has calculations to back it up.\n8.

    "response": "```explanations\n1. The feedback resistance and capacitance for the charge amplifier block are not provided, so it is not possible to confirm if their product is around 2/pi.\n\n2. The gain (20 MV/C) and the peak output charge (50 pC) are given, but the feedback capacitance is not mentioned, making it impossible to evaluate whether the condition G x 1.61p / Cf is roughly around 1.\n\n3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be 50 pC, which does not meet the requirement of being around 161 pC.\n\n4. The bias current is not mentioned in the provided summary.\n\n5. Since neither the feedback resistance nor the bias current is provided, this requirement cannot be evaluated.\n\n6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the output from a piezoelectric sensor, meeting this requirement.\n\n7. The project includes a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of approximately 5 Hz, which would allow signals at 2 Hz to pass through, and the calculations for the filter are provided. However, there are no explicit calculations for the input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude in relation to the charge amplifier optimization.\n\n8. The output voltage is specified to be 1 V peak to peak, meeting this requirement.\n\n9. The offset voltage is not mentioned, so it is not possible to evaluate whether it is kept below 10 mV.\n\nThe project summary covers items 6 and 8 explicitly. The other requirements are either not met or not mentioned in the summary provided.\n```\n\nNEWLINE\n\n```score\n2\n```",
