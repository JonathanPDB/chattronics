Score: 2
Explanations: 
1. The feedback resistance (R_f) is 1.5 G立 and the feedback capacitance (C_f) is 0.47 pF. The product R_f * C_f = 1.5 G立 * 0.47 pF = 705 pF立, which is not close to the required 2/pi (approximately 0.637 pF立), even considering a 10% difference. This requirement is not met.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not explicitly mentioned, which means we cannot calculate the value of G x 1.61p / C_f to verify if it is roughly around 1. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not specifically mentioned; however, the accelerometer sensitivity is given as 100 pC/g and the system is designed to ensure a 1 Vpp output from the accelerometer charge. Without further information on the charge to voltage conversion factor, this requirement cannot be confirmed.

4. The bias current is mentioned as being low due to the selection of a FET input op-amp, but the exact value is not provided. This requirement is not met.

5. The bias current is supposed to be 0.01 / R_f. Without the exact value of the bias current, we cannot confirm that 0.01 / R_f equals the bias current. This requirement is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the signal from the piezoelectric sensor, as mentioned in the overall system architecture. This requirement is met.

7. The project includes a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz, which matches the optimization for an input oscillation of 2 Hz. However, there is no mention of the 5 cm amplitude or calculations to back this up. This requirement is partially met.

8. The charge amplifier gain is designed to ensure a 1 Vpp output from the accelerometer charge. This requirement is met.

9. Offset considerations are mentioned in the design considerations, stating that calibration routines and adjustable components are included to compensate for sensor and system offsets. However, without quantitative values, we cannot confirm that the offset is kept below 10 mV. This requirement is not met.

Based on the information provided, the project meets requirements 6 and 8 fully, and requirement 7 partially. However, due to the lack of explicit information on some requirements, and numerical values that do not meet the given criteria, the score is 2.
