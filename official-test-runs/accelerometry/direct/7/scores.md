Score: 3
Explanations: 
The project summary provided covers the following items:

1. The feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance (Rf x Cf) is not explicitly given. The feedback resistor Rf is given as 620 kÎ© and the feedback capacitance Cf as 1000 pF (or 1 nF). Multiplying these gives Rf x Cf = 620e3 x 1e-9 = 0.62 s, which is not close to the requirement of 2/pi (approximately 0.637). This requirement is not met within the allowed 10% difference.

2. The gain of the charge amplifier is not explicitly mentioned, and thus the calculation of the gain multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by Cf cannot be verified. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not mentioned in the provided summary, and thus the value of 161 pC cannot be confirmed. This requirement is not met.

4. There is no mention of bias current being provided in the summary. This requirement is not met.

5. The summary does not mention the bias current being equal to 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance. This requirement is not met.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, as stated in the summary. This requirement is met.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation with calculations to back it up. The summary mentions a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz, which is part of the optimization for low-frequency vibration measurement. However, there is no explicit mention of calculations for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

8. The summary states an output voltage of 1 V peak-to-peak, which meets this requirement.

9. The offset voltage is maintained below 10 mV, which meets this requirement.

In summary, the project successfully covers items 6, 8, and 9.
