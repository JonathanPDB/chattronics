1. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is +/- 10 V
3. The architecture is simple: there is a voltage divider (with or without a voltage buffer), an anti-aliasing filter and then the DAQ measures the voltage.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered in 0, for example, +/- 7V.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is 7V (this is absolutely necessary and fatal if false)
6. The is a low pass filter (or anti-aliasing filter) that avoids a aliasing
7. There is a filter removing frequencies between around 50 and 60 Hz
8. The filter has a cutoff frequency and order such that the gain of the signal is of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz
