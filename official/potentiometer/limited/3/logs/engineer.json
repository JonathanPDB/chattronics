Potentiometer:\n   - Objective: To convert the mechanical angle of the pendulum to a corresponding electrical signal (voltage).\n   - Functionality: As the pendulum moves, the resistance of the potentiometer changes, which leads to a change in the voltage across the wiper of the potentiometer. Since the pendulum angle range is from 45 to 135 degrees, the potentiometer needs to convert this mechanical range into a proportional voltage change.\n\n2. Buffer:\n   - Objective: To prevent the potentiometer from being loaded by the subsequent circuit stages, ensuring that the voltage change accurately represents the angle.\n   - Functionality: The buffer provides a high input impedance to avoid loading the potentiometer and a low output impedance to drive the following stages.\n\n3. Scale and Shift:\n   - Objective: To adjust the voltage range from the potentiometer to match the DAQ's input voltage range.\n   - Functionality: This block scales down the potentiometer output voltage to ensure the voltage does not exceed +/- 7 V at the DAQ's input. It also shifts the voltage levels, so that the 90-degree (steady) position corresponds to 0 V if required by the DAQ.\n\n4. Band-Stop Filter:\n   - Objective: To attenuate unwanted signals around 50 and 60 Hz, which can interfere with the accuracy of the angle measurement.\n   - Functionality: A band-stop (notch) filter is used to attenuate signals at specific frequencies, in this case, the power line frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz.\n\n5. Anti-Aliasing Filter:\n   - Objective: To remove high-frequency signals that can cause aliasing when the analog signal is sampled by the DAQ.\n   - Functionality: This low-pass filter allows signals within the bandwidth of interest (potentially below half the DAQ's sampling rate of 1000 samples per second) to pass while blocking higher frequency signals to satisfy the Nyquist criterion and ensure accurate digital representation of the analog signal.\n\n6. DAQ:\n   - Objective: To sample and digitize the conditioned analog signal from the pendulum angle measurement for further processing or display.\n   - Functionality: The DAQ operates at a sampling rate of 1000 samples per second, converting the analog voltage signal into digital data without any alterations to the configuration.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nBand_Stop_Filter\n\nTopology:\n- A Twin-T Notch Filter is recommended for its simplicity and effectiveness in attenuating specific frequencies. This passive filter is easy to design and build with standard electronic components.\n\nRequirements:\n- Attenuation: For power line noise suppression, an attenuation of at least 20 dB at 50 Hz and 60 Hz is often considered sufficient to minimize interference. \n- Bandwidth: To avoid affecting nearby frequencies of interest, a narrow bandwidth around the notch frequencies should be selected. A quality factor (Q) of around 10 could be a good starting point. \n- Insertion Loss: The filter should have minimal impact on the desired signal. For audio and low-frequency applications, an insertion loss of less than 3 dB is generally acceptable.\n\nComponent Values (assuming a source and load impedance of 10 kOhms):\n- For 50 Hz Notch:\n  - Capacitors (C1 and C2): 3.18 uF\n  - Resistors (R1 and R2): 318 Ohms\n  - Resistor (R3): 31.8 kOhms (for the depth of the notch)\n\n- For 60 Hz Notch (values adjusted for the higher frequency):\n  - Capacitors (C1 and C2): 2.65 uF\n  - Resistors (R1 and R2): 265 Ohms\n  - Resistor (R3): 26.5 kOhms (for the depth of the notch)\n\nSince the requirement is to attenuate both 50 Hz and 60 Hz, a dual notch filter can be used, combining both sets of values in parallel to create a compound Twin-T that targets both frequencies.\n\nAlternative Options:\n- If more attenuation is required, an active band-stop filter using operational amplifiers could be implemented. This would provide sharper attenuation and better control over the Q factor.\n- For a higher Q factor and more precise control, a state-variable filter or a multiple feedback band-stop filter could be used, but these designs are more complex and require active components.\n\nNote:\n- The exact component values may need to be fine-tuned based on the final circuit impedance and the availability of components.\n- If the source and load impedance differ from the assumed value of 10 kOhms, the component values will need to be recalculated accordingly.\n```",

A safe assumption for the cutoff frequency could be one-tenth of the Nyquist frequency, which would be 50 Hz.\n- A typical requirement for signal distortion within the frequency range of interest would be minimal, suggesting an amplitude attenuation of no more than 3 dB at the cutoff frequency.\n- Without specific environmental or packaging constraints, the filter should be designed for general-purpose use, operating within 0°C to 70°C.\n- As the power supply details are not provided, the filter should be passive to avoid any issues with power supply voltages and consumption.\n- A Butterworth filter design is often preferred for its flat passband characteristic and phase response. Given the need for simplicity and low phase distortion, a second-order (two-pole) Butterworth filter would be a good balance between attenuation and phase linearity.\n\nTherefore, the suggested topology for the anti-aliasing filter is a passive second-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz. This will provide a smooth transition from passband to stopband while maintaining phase integrity and is simple to implement. Passive components such as resistors and capacitors would be used, where the value of the resistors (R) and capacitors (C) can be calculated as follows:\n\n- The cutoff frequency (fc) formula for a second-order low-pass filter is fc = 1 / (2 * π * √(R * C)).\n- Choosing standard values, for R = 3.2 kOhms, C would be approximately 1 uF to achieve the desired 50 Hz cutoff frequency.\n\nThe filter's transfer function would be:\nH(s) = 1 / (s^2 + s*(1/(Q*R*C)) + 1/(R^2*C^2)),\nwhere Q is the quality factor of the Butterworth filter (Q = 1/√2 for a 2-pole Butterworth filter).\n\nThe filter will attenuate frequencies above 50 Hz to prevent aliasing effects while allowing the pendulum's operational frequencies to pass with minimal attenuation and phase distortion.\n```",

Potentiometer:\n   - Objective: To convert the mechanical angle of the pendulum to a corresponding electrical signal (voltage).\n   - Functionality: As the pendulum moves, the resistance of the potentiometer changes, which leads to a change in the voltage across the wiper of the potentiometer. Since the pendulum angle range is from 45 to 135 degrees, the potentiometer needs to convert this mechanical range into a proportional voltage change.\n\n2. Buffer:\n   - Objective: To prevent the potentiometer from being loaded by the subsequent circuit stages, ensuring that the voltage change accurately represents the angle.\n   - Functionality: The buffer provides a high input impedance to avoid loading the potentiometer and a low output impedance to drive the following stages.\n\n3. Scale and Shift:\n   - Objective: To adjust the voltage range from the potentiometer to match the DAQ's input voltage range.\n   - Functionality: This block scales down the potentiometer output voltage to ensure the voltage does not exceed +/- 7 V at the DAQ's input. It also shifts the voltage levels, so that the 90-degree (steady) position corresponds to 0 V if required by the DAQ.\n\n4. Band-Stop Filter:\n   - Objective: To attenuate unwanted signals around 50 and 60 Hz, which can interfere with the accuracy of the angle measurement.\n   - Functionality: A band-stop (notch) filter is used to attenuate signals at specific frequencies, in this case, the power line frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz.\n\n5. Anti-Aliasing Filter:\n   - Objective: To remove high-frequency signals that can cause aliasing when the analog signal is sampled by the DAQ.\n   - Functionality: This low-pass filter allows signals within the bandwidth of interest (potentially below half the DAQ's sampling rate of 1000 samples per second) to pass while blocking higher frequency signals to satisfy the Nyquist criterion and ensure accurate digital representation of the analog signal.\n\n6. DAQ:\n   - Objective: To sample and digitize the conditioned analog signal from the pendulum angle measurement for further processing or display.\n   - Functionality: The DAQ operates at a sampling rate of 1000 samples per second, converting the analog voltage signal into digital data without any alterations to the configuration.\n```",

Given the +/-7V input range, this will result in a voltage resolution of approximately 3.4 mV (14 V / 4096). This should be sufficient for detecting small changes in the pendulum's angle if the potentiometer's output voltage spans the required range.\n\n- Sampling Rate: 1000 samples per second (1 kSPS)\n  The DAQ has been stated to sample at 1000 samples per second, which should be matched by the ADC to ensure no loss of data.\n\n- Input Voltage Range: Configurable to +/-7 V\n  The ADC should support an input range that matches the DAQ's maximum accepted input voltage. Some SAR ADCs have programmable gain amplifiers (PGAs) that allow the input voltage range to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n- Anti-Aliasing Filter:\n  An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz (half of the sampling rate, to satisfy Nyquist criteria) should be implemented before the ADC to prevent aliasing.\n\n- Band-stop Filter:\n  A band-stop filter should be designed to attenuate 50 and 60 Hz signals before the ADC to avoid power line noise interference. The notch depth should be sufficient to bring these signals below the noise floor of the ADC.\n\n- Accuracy:\n  The accuracy of the ADC should be within the resolution limits, taking into account the inherent non-linearity, gain error, and offset error of the ADC itself.\n\n- Speed:\n  The conversion time for a SAR ADC is typically in the microseconds range, which is suitable for the 1 kSPS requirement.\n\n- ADC Driver:\n  An ADC driver may be required to interface the analog signal conditioning stages with the ADC input. This will buffer the signal and match the impedances to ensure accurate conversion.\n\n- Reference Voltage:\n  A stable and precise reference voltage equal to or just above the maximum expected input voltage (7 V) will be necessary to achieve the full dynamic range of the ADC.\n\nThis ADC configuration should be compatible with the DAQ and the rest of the system, providing accurate digital representation of the pendulum's angular position.\n```",

Potentiometer:\n   - Objective: To convert the mechanical angle of the pendulum to a corresponding electrical signal (voltage).\n   - Functionality: As the pendulum moves, the resistance of the potentiometer changes, which leads to a change in the voltage across the wiper of the potentiometer. Since the pendulum angle range is from 45 to 135 degrees, the potentiometer needs to convert this mechanical range into a proportional voltage change.\n\n2. Buffer:\n   - Objective: To prevent the potentiometer from being loaded by the subsequent circuit stages, ensuring that the voltage change accurately represents the angle.\n   - Functionality: The buffer provides a high input impedance to avoid loading the potentiometer and a low output impedance to drive the following stages.\n\n3. Scale and Shift:\n   - Objective: To adjust the voltage range from the potentiometer to match the DAQ's input voltage range.\n   - Functionality: This block scales down the potentiometer output voltage to ensure the voltage does not exceed +/- 7 V at the DAQ's input. It also shifts the voltage levels, so that the 90-degree (steady) position corresponds to 0 V if required by the DAQ.\n\n4. Band-Stop Filter:\n   - Objective: To attenuate unwanted signals around 50 and 60 Hz, which can interfere with the accuracy of the angle measurement.\n   - Functionality: A band-stop (notch) filter is used to attenuate signals at specific frequencies, in this case, the power line frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz.\n\n5. Anti-Aliasing Filter:\n   - Objective: To remove high-frequency signals that can cause aliasing when the analog signal is sampled by the DAQ.\n   - Functionality: This low-pass filter allows signals within the bandwidth of interest (potentially below half the DAQ's sampling rate of 1000 samples per second) to pass while blocking higher frequency signals to satisfy the Nyquist criterion and ensure accurate digital representation of the analog signal.\n\n6. DAQ:\n   - Objective: To sample and digitize the conditioned analog signal from the pendulum angle measurement for further processing or display.\n   - Functionality: The DAQ operates at a sampling rate of 1000 samples per second, converting the analog voltage signal into digital data without any alterations to the configuration.\n```",

The power dissipation in the potentiometer at maximum voltage would be P = V²/R = 20²/10000 = 0.04W, well within the rating of a standard potentiometer.\n- Resolution and sensitivity: Assuming that the DAQ system can measure the smallest voltage change reliably, the potentiometer's resolution is effectively infinite. However, the physical resolution might be limited by the mechanical construction. For most applications, a standard potentiometer provides more than adequate resolution.\n- The 3590S-2-103L model is robust enough to handle typical environmental conditions and mechanical stresses encountered in non-extreme conditions. For harsh environments, additional protective measures such as covers or seals may be necessary.\n- A linear taper potentiometer is selected for simplicity and ease of implementation. The selected model with a single-turn operation is deemed suitable for the 90-degree range of motion required by the project.\n\nNotes:\n- The sensitivity of the potentiometer can be calculated based on the voltage range and the angular range. Assuming the potentiometer wiper voltage varies linearly from -10V at 45 degrees to +10V at 135 degrees, the sensitivity is 20V / 90 degrees = 0.2222V/degree.\n- The potentiometer should be mounted such that its mechanical range matches the angular range of the pendulum to utilize the full electrical range and improve the accuracy of the measurement.\n```",

The op-amp should also have low input bias current, low offset voltage, and low noise. It must be capable of driving the expected load of the DAQ system without significant voltage drop.\n\nGain:\nThe buffer will have a unity gain (gain of 1), as its function is to isolate the potentiometer from the following stages without altering the signal amplitude.\n\nBandwidth:\nThe bandwidth of the buffer should be at least ten times the DAQ's sampling frequency to prevent aliasing and ensure accurate representation of the signal. Therefore, a minimum bandwidth of 10 kHz is recommended.\n\nPower Supply:\nThe buffer circuit should be powered by the same -10 V to 10 V range used for the potentiometer.

Since the pendulum angle range is from 45 to 135 degrees, the potentiometer needs to convert this mechanical range into a proportional voltage change.\n\n2. Buffer:\n   - Objective: To prevent the potentiometer from being loaded by the subsequent circuit stages, ensuring that the voltage change accurately represents the angle.\n   - Functionality: The buffer provides a high input impedance to avoid loading the potentiometer and a low output impedance to drive the following stages.\n\n3. Scale and Shift:\n   - Objective: To adjust the voltage range from the potentiometer to match the DAQ's input voltage range.\n   - Functionality: This block scales down the potentiometer output voltage to ensure the voltage does not exceed +/- 7 V at the DAQ's input.

Band-Stop Filter:\n   - Objective: To attenuate unwanted signals around 50 and 60 Hz, which can interfere with the accuracy of the angle measurement.\n   - Functionality: A band-stop (notch) filter is used to attenuate signals at specific frequencies, in this case, the power line frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz.\n\n5. Anti-Aliasing Filter:\n   - Objective: To remove high-frequency signals that can cause aliasing when the analog signal is sampled by the DAQ.\n   - Functionality: This low-pass filter allows signals within the bandwidth of interest (potentially below half the DAQ's sampling rate of 1000 samples per second) to pass while blocking higher frequency signals to satisfy the Nyquist criterion and ensure accurate digital representation of the analog signal.\n\n6.

    "response": "```Details\nSCALE_AND_SHIFT_BLOCK\n\nTopology Suggestion and Numerical Values:\n\nGiven the lack of specific requirements and considering the simplest design for functionality, I would suggest the following approach for the Scale and Shift block:\n\n1. Voltage Divider (Scaling):\n   - To scale the voltage from the potentiometer to the DAQ's accepted range, a voltage divider can be used. However, since the potentiometer itself acts as a variable voltage divider, we may only need an additional resistive divider if the potentiometer's output range exceeds the DAQ's input range.\n\n2. Op-Amp Scaling and Level Shifting Circuit:\n   - An operational amplifier (op-amp) in a non-inverting configuration can be used to scale and shift the voltage simultaneously. This choice allows precise control over the gain and offset voltage.\n   - Since the potentiometer's power supply is -10 to 10 Volts, the midpoint (0 V) corresponds to the 90-degree position of the pendulum. We can assume that the potentiometer gives a linear response over its mechanical range, being at 5kΩ at 90 degrees.\n\nAssuming a linear response from the potentiometer:\n- At 45 degrees, the potentiometer's resistance would be 75% of its total resistance (from the wiper to one end), giving us -5 V at the wiper.\n- At 135 degrees, the resistance would be 25% of the total resistance, giving us +5 V.\n\nWe want to scale this -5 to +5 V range to fit within the DAQ's input range of +/- 7 V. Since the range is already within the DAQ's limits, we only need to shift the output if required by the DAQ's expected zero reference.\n\nFor the op-amp: \n- Gain (Av) should be 1 (no scaling required).\n- Vref (reference voltage) should be set to 0 V if the DAQ expects 0 V for the 90-degree position.\n- If the DAQ requires, for instance, 90 degrees to correspond to -7 V, then Vref should be set to -7 V.\n\nUsing an op-amp like the LM358 (common and suitable for general purposes), the circuit would include:\n- Rf (feedback resistor) and Ri (input resistor) should be chosen to have equal values for a gain of 1 (for example, 10kΩ each).\n- Vref connected to the non-inverting input through a voltage divider or a reference voltage source to set the desired level shift.\n\nPassive Components (if Vref is 0 V):\n- Rf = 10kΩ (1% tolerance for precision)\n- Ri = 10kΩ (1% tolerance)\n\nActive Components:\n- U1 = LM358 Op-Amp (or equivalent)\n\nIn this configuration, the output voltage will linearly follow the input from the potentiometer without scaling but will shift according to the Vref applied. The DAQ will then receive a signal that is within its acceptable range and properly centered around its expected zero reference.\n```\n",

This passive filter is easy to design and build with standard electronic components.\n\nRequirements:\n- Attenuation: For power line noise suppression, an attenuation of at least 20 dB at 50 Hz and 60 Hz is often considered sufficient to minimize interference. \n- Bandwidth: To avoid affecting nearby frequencies of interest, a narrow bandwidth around the notch frequencies should be selected. A quality factor (Q) of around 10 could be a good starting point. \n- Insertion Loss: The filter should have minimal impact on the desired signal. For audio and low-frequency applications, an insertion loss of less than 3 dB is generally acceptable.\n\nComponent Values (assuming a source and load impedance of 10 kOhms):\n- For 50 Hz Notch:\n  - Capacitors (C1 and C2): 3.18 uF\n  - Resistors (R1 and R2): 318 Ohms\n  - Resistor (R3): 31.8 kOhms (for the depth of the notch)\n\n- For 60 Hz Notch (values adjusted for the higher frequency):\n  - Capacitors (C1 and C2): 2.65 uF\n  - Resistors (R1 and R2): 265 Ohms\n  - Resistor (R3): 26.5 kOhms (for the depth of the notch)\n\nSince the requirement is to attenuate both 50 Hz and 60 Hz, a dual notch filter can be used, combining both sets of values in parallel to create a compound Twin-T that targets both frequencies.\n\nAlternative Options:\n- If more attenuation is required, an active band-stop filter using operational amplifiers could be implemented. This would provide sharper attenuation and better control over the Q factor.\n- For a higher Q factor and more precise control, a state-variable filter or a multiple feedback band-stop filter could be used, but these designs are more complex and require active components.\n\nNote:\n- The exact component values may need to be fine-tuned based on the final circuit impedance and the availability of components.\n- If the source and load impedance differ from the assumed value of 10 kOhms, the component values will need to be recalculated accordingly.\n```",

A safe assumption for the cutoff frequency could be one-tenth of the Nyquist frequency, which would be 50 Hz.\n- A typical requirement for signal distortion within the frequency range of interest would be minimal, suggesting an amplitude attenuation of no more than 3 dB at the cutoff frequency.\n- Without specific environmental or packaging constraints, the filter should be designed for general-purpose use, operating within 0°C to 70°C.\n- As the power supply details are not provided, the filter should be passive to avoid any issues with power supply voltages and consumption.\n- A Butterworth filter design is often preferred for its flat passband characteristic and phase response. Given the need for simplicity and low phase distortion, a second-order (two-pole) Butterworth filter would be a good balance between attenuation and phase linearity.\n\nTherefore, the suggested topology for the anti-aliasing filter is a passive second-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz. This will provide a smooth transition from passband to stopband while maintaining phase integrity and is simple to implement. Passive components such as resistors and capacitors would be used, where the value of the resistors (R) and capacitors (C) can be calculated as follows:\n\n- The cutoff frequency (fc) formula for a second-order low-pass filter is fc = 1 / (2 * π * √(R * C)).\n- Choosing standard values, for R = 3.2 kOhms, C would be approximately 1 uF to achieve the desired 50 Hz cutoff frequency.\n\nThe filter's transfer function would be:\nH(s) = 1 / (s^2 + s*(1/(Q*R*C)) + 1/(R^2*C^2)),\nwhere Q is the quality factor of the Butterworth filter (Q = 1/√2 for a 2-pole Butterworth filter).\n\nThe filter will attenuate frequencies above 50 Hz to prevent aliasing effects while allowing the pendulum's operational frequencies to pass with minimal attenuation and phase distortion.\n```",

Given the +/-7V input range, this will result in a voltage resolution of approximately 3.4 mV (14 V / 4096). This should be sufficient for detecting small changes in the pendulum's angle if the potentiometer's output voltage spans the required range.\n\n- Sampling Rate: 1000 samples per second (1 kSPS)\n  The DAQ has been stated to sample at 1000 samples per second, which should be matched by the ADC to ensure no loss of data.\n\n- Input Voltage Range: Configurable to +/-7 V\n  The ADC should support an input range that matches the DAQ's maximum accepted input voltage. Some SAR ADCs have programmable gain amplifiers (PGAs) that allow the input voltage range to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n- Anti-Aliasing Filter:\n  An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz (half of the sampling rate, to satisfy Nyquist criteria) should be implemented before the ADC to prevent aliasing.\n\n- Band-stop Filter:\n  A band-stop filter should be designed to attenuate 50 and 60 Hz signals before the ADC to avoid power line noise interference. The notch depth should be sufficient to bring these signals below the noise floor of the ADC.\n\n- Accuracy:\n  The accuracy of the ADC should be within the resolution limits, taking into account the inherent non-linearity, gain error, and offset error of the ADC itself.\n\n- Speed:\n  The conversion time for a SAR ADC is typically in the microseconds range, which is suitable for the 1 kSPS requirement.\n\n- ADC Driver:\n  An ADC driver may be required to interface the analog signal conditioning stages with the ADC input. This will buffer the signal and match the impedances to ensure accurate conversion.\n\n- Reference Voltage:\n  A stable and precise reference voltage equal to or just above the maximum expected input voltage (7 V) will be necessary to achieve the full dynamic range of the ADC.\n\nThis ADC configuration should be compatible with the DAQ and the rest of the system, providing accurate digital representation of the pendulum's angular position.\n```",

The power dissipation in the potentiometer at maximum voltage would be P = V²/R = 20²/10000 = 0.04W, well within the rating of a standard potentiometer.\n- Resolution and sensitivity: Assuming that the DAQ system can measure the smallest voltage change reliably, the potentiometer's resolution is effectively infinite. However, the physical resolution might be limited by the mechanical construction. For most applications, a standard potentiometer provides more than adequate resolution.\n- The 3590S-2-103L model is robust enough to handle typical environmental conditions and mechanical stresses encountered in non-extreme conditions. For harsh environments, additional protective measures such as covers or seals may be necessary.\n- A linear taper potentiometer is selected for simplicity and ease of implementation. The selected model with a single-turn operation is deemed suitable for the 90-degree range of motion required by the project.\n\nNotes:\n- The sensitivity of the potentiometer can be calculated based on the voltage range and the angular range. Assuming the potentiometer wiper voltage varies linearly from -10V at 45 degrees to +10V at 135 degrees, the sensitivity is 20V / 90 degrees = 0.2222V/degree.\n- The potentiometer should be mounted such that its mechanical range matches the angular range of the pendulum to utilize the full electrical range and improve the accuracy of the measurement.\n```",

Voltage Divider (Scaling):\n   - To scale the voltage from the potentiometer to the DAQ's accepted range, a voltage divider can be used. However, since the potentiometer itself acts as a variable voltage divider, we may only need an additional resistive divider if the potentiometer's output range exceeds the DAQ's input range.\n\n2. Op-Amp Scaling and Level Shifting Circuit:\n   - An operational amplifier (op-amp) in a non-inverting configuration can be used to scale and shift the voltage simultaneously. This choice allows precise control over the gain and offset voltage.\n   - Since the potentiometer's power supply is -10 to 10 Volts, the midpoint (0 V) corresponds to the 90-degree position of the pendulum. We can assume that the potentiometer gives a linear response over its mechanical range, being at 5kΩ at 90 degrees.\n\nAssuming a linear response from the potentiometer:\n- At 45 degrees, the potentiometer's resistance would be 75% of its total resistance (from the wiper to one end), giving us -5 V at the wiper.\n- At 135 degrees, the resistance would be 25% of the total resistance, giving us +5 V.\n\nWe want to scale this -5 to +5 V range to fit within the DAQ's input range of +/- 7 V. Since the range is already within the DAQ's limits, we only need to shift the output if required by the DAQ's expected zero reference.\n\nFor the op-amp: \n- Gain (Av) should be 1 (no scaling required).\n- Vref (reference voltage) should be set to 0 V if the DAQ expects 0 V for the 90-degree position.\n- If the DAQ requires, for instance, 90 degrees to correspond to -7 V, then Vref should be set to -7 V.\n\nUsing an op-amp like the LM358 (common and suitable for general purposes), the circuit would include:\n- Rf (feedback resistor) and Ri (input resistor) should be chosen to have equal values for a gain of 1 (for example, 10kΩ each).\n- Vref connected to the non-inverting input through a voltage divider or a reference voltage source to set the desired level shift.\n\nPassive Components (if Vref is 0 V):\n- Rf = 10kΩ (1% tolerance for precision)\n- Ri = 10kΩ (1% tolerance)\n\nActive Components:\n- U1 = LM358 Op-Amp (or equivalent)\n\nIn this configuration, the output voltage will linearly follow the input from the potentiometer without scaling but will shift according to the Vref applied. The DAQ will then receive a signal that is within its acceptable range and properly centered around its expected zero reference.\n```\n",

Potentiometer:\n   - Objective: To convert the mechanical angle of the pendulum to a corresponding electrical signal (voltage).\n   - Functionality: As the pendulum moves, the resistance of the potentiometer changes, which leads to a change in the voltage across the wiper of the potentiometer. Since the pendulum angle range is from 45 to 135 degrees, the potentiometer needs to convert this mechanical range into a proportional voltage change.\n\n2. Buffer:\n   - Objective: To prevent the potentiometer from being loaded by the subsequent circuit stages, ensuring that the voltage change accurately represents the angle.\n   - Functionality: The buffer provides a high input impedance to avoid loading the potentiometer and a low output impedance to drive the following stages.\n\n3. Scale and Shift:\n   - Objective: To adjust the voltage range from the potentiometer to match the DAQ's input voltage range.\n   - Functionality: This block scales down the potentiometer output voltage to ensure the voltage does not exceed +/- 7 V at the DAQ's input. It also shifts the voltage levels, so that the 90-degree (steady) position corresponds to 0 V if required by the DAQ.\n\n4. Band-Stop Filter:\n   - Objective: To attenuate unwanted signals around 50 and 60 Hz, which can interfere with the accuracy of the angle measurement.\n   - Functionality: A band-stop (notch) filter is used to attenuate signals at specific frequencies, in this case, the power line frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz.\n\n5. Anti-Aliasing Filter:\n   - Objective: To remove high-frequency signals that can cause aliasing when the analog signal is sampled by the DAQ.\n   - Functionality: This low-pass filter allows signals within the bandwidth of interest (potentially below half the DAQ's sampling rate of 1000 samples per second) to pass while blocking higher frequency signals to satisfy the Nyquist criterion and ensure accurate digital representation of the analog signal.\n\n6. DAQ:\n   - Objective: To sample and digitize the conditioned analog signal from the pendulum angle measurement for further processing or display.\n   - Functionality: The DAQ operates at a sampling rate of 1000 samples per second, converting the analog voltage signal into digital data without any alterations to the configuration.\n```"

This passive filter is easy to design and build with standard electronic components.\n\nRequirements:\n- Attenuation: For power line noise suppression, an attenuation of at least 20 dB at 50 Hz and 60 Hz is often considered sufficient to minimize interference. \n- Bandwidth: To avoid affecting nearby frequencies of interest, a narrow bandwidth around the notch frequencies should be selected. A quality factor (Q) of around 10 could be a good starting point. \n- Insertion Loss: The filter should have minimal impact on the desired signal. For audio and low-frequency applications, an insertion loss of less than 3 dB is generally acceptable.\n\nComponent Values (assuming a source and load impedance of 10 kOhms):\n- For 50 Hz Notch:\n  - Capacitors (C1 and C2): 3.18 uF\n  - Resistors (R1 and R2): 318 Ohms\n  - Resistor (R3): 31.8 kOhms (for the depth of the notch)\n\n- For 60 Hz Notch (values adjusted for the higher frequency):\n  - Capacitors (C1 and C2): 2.65 uF\n  - Resistors (R1 and R2): 265 Ohms\n  - Resistor (R3): 26.5 kOhms (for the depth of the notch)\n\nSince the requirement is to attenuate both 50 Hz and 60 Hz, a dual notch filter can be used, combining both sets of values in parallel to create a compound Twin-T that targets both frequencies.\n\nAlternative Options:\n- If more attenuation is required, an active band-stop filter using operational amplifiers could be implemented. This would provide sharper attenuation and better control over the Q factor.\n- For a higher Q factor and more precise control, a state-variable filter or a multiple feedback band-stop filter could be used, but these designs are more complex and require active components.\n\nNote:\n- The exact component values may need to be fine-tuned based on the final circuit impedance and the availability of components.\n- If the source and load impedance differ from the assumed value of 10 kOhms, the component values will need to be recalculated accordingly.\n```"

A safe assumption for the cutoff frequency could be one-tenth of the Nyquist frequency, which would be 50 Hz.\n- A typical requirement for signal distortion within the frequency range of interest would be minimal, suggesting an amplitude attenuation of no more than 3 dB at the cutoff frequency.\n- Without specific environmental or packaging constraints, the filter should be designed for general-purpose use, operating within 0°C to 70°C.\n- As the power supply details are not provided, the filter should be passive to avoid any issues with power supply voltages and consumption.\n- A Butterworth filter design is often preferred for its flat passband characteristic and phase response. Given the need for simplicity and low phase distortion, a second-order (two-pole) Butterworth filter would be a good balance between attenuation and phase linearity.\n\nTherefore, the suggested topology for the anti-aliasing filter is a passive second-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz. This will provide a smooth transition from passband to stopband while maintaining phase integrity and is simple to implement. Passive components such as resistors and capacitors would be used, where the value of the resistors (R) and capacitors (C) can be calculated as follows:\n\n- The cutoff frequency (fc) formula for a second-order low-pass filter is fc = 1 / (2 * π * √(R * C)).\n- Choosing standard values, for R = 3.2 kOhms, C would be approximately 1 uF to achieve the desired 50 Hz cutoff frequency.\n\nThe filter's transfer function would be:\nH(s) = 1 / (s^2 + s*(1/(Q*R*C)) + 1/(R^2*C^2)),\nwhere Q is the quality factor of the Butterworth filter (Q = 1/√2 for a 2-pole Butterworth filter).\n\nThe filter will attenuate frequencies above 50 Hz to prevent aliasing effects while allowing the pendulum's operational frequencies to pass with minimal attenuation and phase distortion.\n```"

Given the +/-7V input range, this will result in a voltage resolution of approximately 3.4 mV (14 V / 4096). This should be sufficient for detecting small changes in the pendulum's angle if the potentiometer's output voltage spans the required range.\n\n- Sampling Rate: 1000 samples per second (1 kSPS)\n  The DAQ has been stated to sample at 1000 samples per second, which should be matched by the ADC to ensure no loss of data.\n\n- Input Voltage Range: Configurable to +/-7 V\n  The ADC should support an input range that matches the DAQ's maximum accepted input voltage. Some SAR ADCs have programmable gain amplifiers (PGAs) that allow the input voltage range to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n- Anti-Aliasing Filter:\n  An anti-aliasing filter with a cutoff frequency just below 500 Hz (half of the sampling rate, to satisfy Nyquist criteria) should be implemented before the ADC to prevent aliasing.\n\n- Band-stop Filter:\n  A band-stop filter should be designed to attenuate 50 and 60 Hz signals before the ADC to avoid power line noise interference. The notch depth should be sufficient to bring these signals below the noise floor of the ADC.\n\n- Accuracy:\n  The accuracy of the ADC should be within the resolution limits, taking into account the inherent non-linearity, gain error, and offset error of the ADC itself.\n\n- Speed:\n  The conversion time for a SAR ADC is typically in the microseconds range, which is suitable for the 1 kSPS requirement.\n\n- ADC Driver:\n  An ADC driver may be required to interface the analog signal conditioning stages with the ADC input. This will buffer the signal and match the impedances to ensure accurate conversion.\n\n- Reference Voltage:\n  A stable and precise reference voltage equal to or just above the maximum expected input voltage (7 V) will be necessary to achieve the full dynamic range of the ADC.\n\nThis ADC configuration should be compatible with the DAQ and the rest of the system, providing accurate digital representation of the pendulum's angular position.\n```"

The power dissipation in the potentiometer at maximum voltage would be P = V²/R = 20²/10000 = 0.04W, well within the rating of a standard potentiometer.\n- Resolution and sensitivity: Assuming that the DAQ system can measure the smallest voltage change reliably, the potentiometer's resolution is effectively infinite. However, the physical resolution might be limited by the mechanical construction. For most applications, a standard potentiometer provides more than adequate resolution.\n- The 3590S-2-103L model is robust enough to handle typical environmental conditions and mechanical stresses encountered in non-extreme conditions. For harsh environments, additional protective measures such as covers or seals may be necessary.\n- A linear taper potentiometer is selected for simplicity and ease of implementation. The selected model with a single-turn operation is deemed suitable for the 90-degree range of motion required by the project.\n\nNotes:\n- The sensitivity of the potentiometer can be calculated based on the voltage range and the angular range. Assuming the potentiometer wiper voltage varies linearly from -10V at 45 degrees to +10V at 135 degrees, the sensitivity is 20V / 90 degrees = 0.2222V/degree.\n- The potentiometer should be mounted such that its mechanical range matches the angular range of the pendulum to utilize the full electrical range and improve the accuracy of the measurement.\n```"

Voltage Divider (Scaling):\n   - To scale the voltage from the potentiometer to the DAQ's accepted range, a voltage divider can be used. However, since the potentiometer itself acts as a variable voltage divider, we may only need an additional resistive divider if the potentiometer's output range exceeds the DAQ's input range.\n\n2. Op-Amp Scaling and Level Shifting Circuit:\n   - An operational amplifier (op-amp) in a non-inverting configuration can be used to scale and shift the voltage simultaneously. This choice allows precise control over the gain and offset voltage.\n   - Since the potentiometer's power supply is -10 to 10 Volts, the midpoint (0 V) corresponds to the 90-degree position of the pendulum. We can assume that the potentiometer gives a linear response over its mechanical range, being at 5kΩ at 90 degrees.\n\nAssuming a linear response from the potentiometer:\n- At 45 degrees, the potentiometer's resistance would be 75% of its total resistance (from the wiper to one end), giving us -5 V at the wiper.\n- At 135 degrees, the resistance would be 25% of the total resistance, giving us +5 V.\n\nWe want to scale this -5 to +5 V range to fit within the DAQ's input range of +/- 7 V. Since the range is already within the DAQ's limits, we only need to shift the output if required by the DAQ's expected zero reference.\n\nFor the op-amp: \n- Gain (Av) should be 1 (no scaling required).\n- Vref (reference voltage) should be set to 0 V if the DAQ expects 0 V for the 90-degree position.\n- If the DAQ requires, for instance, 90 degrees to correspond to -7 V, then Vref should be set to -7 V.\n\nUsing an op-amp like the LM358 (common and suitable for general purposes), the circuit would include:\n- Rf (feedback resistor) and Ri (input resistor) should be chosen to have equal values for a gain of 1 (for example, 10kΩ each).\n- Vref connected to the non-inverting input through a voltage divider or a reference voltage source to set the desired level shift.\n\nPassive Components (if Vref is 0 V):\n- Rf = 10kΩ (1% tolerance for precision)\n- Ri = 10kΩ (1% tolerance)\n\nActive Components:\n- U1 = LM358 Op-Amp (or equivalent)\n\nIn this configuration, the output voltage will linearly follow the input from the potentiometer without scaling but will shift according to the Vref applied. The DAQ will then receive a signal that is within its acceptable range and properly centered around its expected zero reference.\n```\n"

So, sensitivity is 10V over a 90-degree range, resulting in 0.2222V/degree.\n- Anti-Aliasing Filter Cutoff Frequency: With a desired cutoff frequency (fc) of 50 Hz and choosing a resistor value (R) of 3.2 kOhms, capacitor (C) value is calculated using fc = 1 / (2 * π * √(R * C)), leading to C ≈ 1 uF.\n\nAll component values and configurations are given based on standard values and typical requirements for such a measurement system. The exact values should be fine-tuned based on the final environment, DAQ input characteristics, and component availability.\n```\n",
