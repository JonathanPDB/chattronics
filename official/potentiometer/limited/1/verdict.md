Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project summary describes a system designed for measuring the angle of a pendulum using a potentiometer and processing the signal for data acquisition. The requirements are largely addressed as follows:

1. The potentiometer is used as a sensor for the pendulum's angle, which implies it is part of a voltage divider circuit.
2. The power supply for the potentiometer is specified to be +/- 10 V, which matches the requirement.
3. The architecture includes a voltage divider, differential amplifier for offset adjustment, amplification block, and multiple filtering stages, followed by a DAQ system.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, with a range of +/- 7V, which is in line with the requirement.
5. The amplification block is designed to ensure that the maximum voltage applied to the DAQ does not exceed 7V.
6. The system includes multiple low-pass filters to avoid aliasing, which fulfills the requirement for an anti-aliasing filter.
7. The first low-pass filter is designed to attenuate 50 Hz interference, and the second one is aimed at attenuating 60 Hz interference, satisfying the requirement for filtering out frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz.
8. The cutoff frequency for the anti-aliasing filter is set at 100 Hz, which is below 500 Hz. However, the order of the filter and the attenuation level at 500 Hz are not explicitly stated. To meet the requirement of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, a higher-order filter or a sharper cutoff might be needed, depending on the actual filter design.

The summary does not explicitly state the order of the anti-aliasing filter or its attenuation at 500 Hz, which is critical to ensure the requirement of at least -20 dB gain at 500 Hz is met. Assuming the Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a Butterworth response has a 12 dB/octave roll-off, a second-order filter would not provide -20 dB attenuation at 500 Hz. Therefore, this aspect of the design needs further clarification or adjustment.

Based on the information provided, the project is categorized as "acceptable" because it can be implemented and does not contain any fatal issues. However, the filter design may need to be revisited to ensure the -20 dB attenuation at 500 Hz is achieved.
