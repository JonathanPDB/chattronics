1. On the charge amplifier, the feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance must be roughly around 2/pi (you can allow up to 10% difference from this value)
2. The charge amplifier gain multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (G x 1.61p / Cf) should be roughly around 1 (you can allow up to 10% difference from this value)
3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC
4. The bias current must be provided
5. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current
6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor
7. The project is optimised for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude and has calculations to back it up.
8. The output voltage is 1 V peak to peak
9. The offset should be kept below 10 mV
