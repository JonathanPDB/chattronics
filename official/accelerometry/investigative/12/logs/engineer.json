Since we do not have a specific model, one can consider a general purpose accelerometer for low-frequency applications, such as the PCB Piezotronics model 352C33 or a similar model from other reputable manufacturers like Bruel \u0026 Kjaer or Kistler.\n- This type of accelerometer will have an internal preamplifier to convert the charge to a low impedance voltage output which can be processed by subsequent stages.\n\nFrequency Range:\n- The device is expected to measure vibrations up to 2 Hz.\n\nAmplitude (Peak Motion):\n- The accelerometer must be capable of detecting the specified peak motion of 5 cm. Since accelerometers measure acceleration, the corresponding acceleration for the peak motion at low frequencies would be quite small, so a high sensitivity accelerometer is appropriate.\n\nResolution:\n- The resolution is not specified, but it should be fine enough to detect the smallest discernible change in vibration that the application requires. For a general guidance, a resolution better than 0.001 g might be sufficient for detecting small variations in low-frequency vibrations.\n\nTemperature Range:\n- While not specified, we can assume the accelerometer should operate in a typical industrial temperature range, from -40°C to +85°C.\n\nPower Supply Requirements:\n- A typical IEPE (Integrated Electronics Piezoelectric) sensor, which includes a built-in preamplifier, typically requires a constant current power supply, usually in the range of 2 to 20 mA at a supply voltage between 18 to 30 VDC.\n\nSensitivity:\n- As indicated, the sensitivity is 100 pC/g. This parameter is crucial for designing the charge amplifier, as it determines the output voltage per unit of acceleration.\n\nEnvironmental Conditions:\n- Although not specified, one could assume a general industrial environment. Thus, the accelerometer should be suitably sealed (IP65 or better) against dust and moisture and capable of withstanding normal handling and operation.\n\nCertifications:\n- No specific certifications are required, but it is recommended to choose a sensor that complies with common industrial standards for reliability and durability.\n\nAttention should be paid to:\n- The mechanical mounting and coupling of the accelerometer to ensure accurate vibration measurements.\n- Ensuring the accelerometer's operating temperature range is suitable for the application.\n- Verifying the accelerometer's frequency response is flat within the desired frequency range, or understanding any deviations so they can be accounted for in data interpretation.\n- Defining a clear resolution requirement to select an accelerometer that meets the application’s needs.\n\nSummary:\nA general-purpose high-sensitivity IEPE piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g and a suitable frequency response for up to 2 Hz will be selected. The model chosen should ideally have a resolution fine enough for the application, a suitable temperature range, and be robust for industrial use. Power requirements are typically within the range for IEPE sensors, and the sensor should be compatible with common industrial standards.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nCharge Amplifier\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the piezoelectric sensor (100 pC/g), the amplifier's gain must be chosen to convert the charge into a usable output voltage range, which typically is within 0 to 5 V or 0 to 10 V in industrial applications. The maximum expected acceleration can be deduced from the peak displacement (5 cm) and the frequency (2 Hz) using the formula:\n\na_max = (2 * π * f)^2 * d\n\nwhere:\na_max = maximum acceleration (in g)\nf = frequency (in Hz)\nd = displacement (in cm)\n\nConverting 5 cm to meters and plugging in the values:\n\na_max = (2 * π * 2)^2 * 0.05\na_max ≈ 0.4 g\n\nNow, the output charge from the sensor at 0.4 g would be:\n\nQ_max = Sensitivity * a_max\nQ_max = 100 pC/g * 0.4 g\nQ_max = 40 pC\n\nThe amplifier must then convert this charge to a voltage that fits within the ADC input range. Assuming a full-scale range of 5 V, you would design the charge amplifier to have a gain that achieves this. The charge amplifier gain G (in V/pC) is given by:\n\nG = V_out / Q_in\n\nFor a maximum output of 5 V:\n\nG = 5 V / 40 pC\nG = 125 V/nC\n\nIn practice, the gain would be set by selecting appropriate feedback components in the charge amplifier circuit. A common instrumentation amplifier IC can be used as the core of the charge amplifier. \n\nAdditionally, considering the 10 mV maximum acceptable offset, an op-amp with a low offset voltage should be selected, and additional offset nulling circuits or calibration procedures may be implemented.\n\nWhile the exact supply voltage limits have not been specified, a dual supply of ±15 V is common for many operational amplifiers and would typically provide sufficient headroom for the output signal.\n\nTo summarize, a charge amplifier with a gain of approximately 125 V/nC using an op-amp with low offset voltage would be suitable. If the supply voltage information becomes available, the chosen op-amp must be compatible with the supply voltage for optimal performance. \n```",

An appropriate cutoff frequency might be chosen to be around 10 Hz to provide a buffer region between the desired signal and the point where attenuation begins, ensuring minimal signal distortion within the passband.\n\nSince no specific requirements for attenuation level, phase response, or environmental conditions were provided, we will assume standard conditions and design goals:\n\n1. A Butterworth filter topology could be used for a maximally flat passband, which means no ripple in the passband and a smooth roll-off starting at 10 Hz. For a sharper transition, a Chebyshev or elliptic filter could be considered, but these introduce passband ripple and phase distortion.\n\n2. A 1st or 2nd-order filter would typically provide a -20 dB/decade or -40 dB/decade roll-off respectively after the cutoff frequency. However, without specifying the required attenuation level, we'll opt for a conservative 2nd-order filter, which generally provides a good balance between complexity and performance.\n\n3. A simple RC (Resistor-Capacitor) low-pass filter is often sufficient for low-order filtering requirements. However, for a more precise cut-off and steeper roll-off, an active filter using operational amplifiers (op-amps) might be used.\n\n4. Assuming a single supply voltage for portability, the filter design should include biasing to ensure the input and output signals are within the op-amp's linear range.\n\n5. For a 2nd-order Butterworth filter with a 10 Hz cutoff frequency, the damping factor (ζ) is 1/√2 (approximately 0.707), which is characteristic of this filter type.\n\nGiven that the requirement for phase response and environmental conditions were not provided, standard commercial-grade components could be used. For applications with environmental concerns or need for a linear phase response, specialized components and more advanced filter topologies like Bessel filters might be considered, which provide a nearly linear phase response.\n\nIn conclusion, for the low-pass filter, a standard 2nd-order Butterworth active filter could be implemented. The following values would be reasonable for a 10 Hz cutoff frequency:\n\n- Op-amp: A low noise, FET-input operational amplifier, such as the TL072, for a good balance between performance and cost.\n- Resistors (R): If we choose standard values, R1 = R2 = 15.9kΩ (to account for the gain of the op-amp and standard resistor values).\n- Capacitors (C): Using the standard formula for a Butterworth filter, C1 = C2 = 1 / (2 * π * R * 10 Hz), which would be approximately 100 nF.\n\nThese component values are suggested starting points and may need to be fine-tuned based on actual system performance and component tolerances.\n```",

    "response": "```Details\nADC_BLOCK\n\nGiven the lack of specific information in the answers, we will proceed with general assumptions for designing the ADC block suitable for low-frequency vibration measurement using a piezoelectric sensor.\n\nSince the frequency of interest is up to 2 Hz, we will design the ADC with the following characteristics:\n\n- Sampling Rate: To avoid aliasing and accurately capture the waveform, we will sample at a rate much higher than the Nyquist rate. We will use a sampling rate of 100 samples per second (100 S/s) which is well above the minimum requirement (4 S/s) and provides ample data points for signal analysis.\n- Resolution: Since the amplitude of the vibration is not given, we will assume a moderate resolution of 16 bits. This will give a high dynamic range to the ADC, suitable for detecting small changes in voltage from the piezoelectric sensor and converting them into a digital value.\n- Input Range: The input range will depend on the output voltage range of the charge amplifier. Without specific information, we will assume the ADC should handle a standard input range of ±10V, which is typical for industrial sensors.\n- Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): We will select an ADC with a high SNR (\u003e90 dB) and low THD to ensure the fidelity of the vibration signal capture is maintained.\n- ADC Topology: A Sigma-Delta (Σ-Δ) ADC topology would be suitable for this application as it provides high-resolution measurements, and the oversampling can inherently filter out noise, improving SNR.\n- Interface: A common serial interface such as SPI or I2C can be used. SPI is preferred for its higher speeds which may be beneficial for real-time applications.\n\nWithout further details, these are generalized recommendations. The user may need to adjust these parameters based on power consumption requirements, specific input voltage range, and available data interfaces.\n```",

The choice of accelerometer will depend on the expected amplitude and frequency range, ensuring it can effectively capture up to 2 Hz vibrations and translate the 5 cm peak motion into a measurable electrical charge.\n\nCharge Amplifier: This block converts the charge generated by the piezoelectric sensor into a voltage.

Its gain will be set to produce a usable output voltage range (e.g., 0-5 V peak-to-peak) from the expected vibration levels.\n\nLow-pass Filter: An analog low-pass filter is required to prevent aliasing before the signal is digitized by the ADC. Given the 2 Hz frequency range of interest, the filter will likely have a cutoff frequency slightly above 2 Hz (e.g., 5-10 Hz) to preserve the desired signal while attenuating higher frequency noise.\n\nADC: The analog-to-digital converter digitizes the conditioned analog signal from the low-pass filter. It should have a sufficient sampling rate (at least twice the highest frequency of interest, so at least 4 samples per second according to the Nyquist Theorem) and resolution to capture the full dynamics of the vibration.\n\nMicrocontroller/DSP: A digital processing unit, such as a microcontroller or digital signal processor (DSP), is required for further signal processing, data analysis, or communication with external devices. This block can also handle tasks like device control, user interface, and data storage/logging if needed.\n```",

Since we do not have a specific model, one can consider a general purpose accelerometer for low-frequency applications, such as the PCB Piezotronics model 352C33 or a similar model from other reputable manufacturers like Bruel \u0026 Kjaer or Kistler.\n- This type of accelerometer will have an internal preamplifier to convert the charge to a low impedance voltage output which can be processed by subsequent stages.\n\nFrequency Range:\n- The device is expected to measure vibrations up to 2 Hz.\n\nAmplitude (Peak Motion):\n- The accelerometer must be capable of detecting the specified peak motion of 5 cm. Since accelerometers measure acceleration, the corresponding acceleration for the peak motion at low frequencies would be quite small, so a high sensitivity accelerometer is appropriate.\n\nResolution:\n- The resolution is not specified, but it should be fine enough to detect the smallest discernible change in vibration that the application requires. For a general guidance, a resolution better than 0.001 g might be sufficient for detecting small variations in low-frequency vibrations.\n\nTemperature Range:\n- While not specified, we can assume the accelerometer should operate in a typical industrial temperature range, from -40°C to +85°C.\n\nPower Supply Requirements:\n- A typical IEPE (Integrated Electronics Piezoelectric) sensor, which includes a built-in preamplifier, typically requires a constant current power supply, usually in the range of 2 to 20 mA at a supply voltage between 18 to 30 VDC.\n\nSensitivity:\n- As indicated, the sensitivity is 100 pC/g. This parameter is crucial for designing the charge amplifier, as it determines the output voltage per unit of acceleration.\n\nEnvironmental Conditions:\n- Although not specified, one could assume a general industrial environment. Thus, the accelerometer should be suitably sealed (IP65 or better) against dust and moisture and capable of withstanding normal handling and operation.\n\nCertifications:\n- No specific certifications are required, but it is recommended to choose a sensor that complies with common industrial standards for reliability and durability.\n\nAttention should be paid to:\n- The mechanical mounting and coupling of the accelerometer to ensure accurate vibration measurements.\n- Ensuring the accelerometer's operating temperature range is suitable for the application.\n- Verifying the accelerometer's frequency response is flat within the desired frequency range, or understanding any deviations so they can be accounted for in data interpretation.\n- Defining a clear resolution requirement to select an accelerometer that meets the application’s needs.\n\nSummary:\nA general-purpose high-sensitivity IEPE piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g and a suitable frequency response for up to 2 Hz will be selected. The model chosen should ideally have a resolution fine enough for the application, a suitable temperature range, and be robust for industrial use. Power requirements are typically within the range for IEPE sensors, and the sensor should be compatible with common industrial standards.\n```",

The maximum expected acceleration can be deduced from the peak displacement (5 cm) and the frequency (2 Hz) using the formula:\n\na_max = (2 * π * f)^2 * d\n\nwhere:\na_max = maximum acceleration (in g)\nf = frequency (in Hz)\nd = displacement (in cm)\n\nConverting 5 cm to meters and plugging in the values:\n\na_max = (2 * π * 2)^2 * 0.05\na_max ≈ 0.4 g\n\nNow, the output charge from the sensor at 0.4 g would be:\n\nQ_max = Sensitivity * a_max\nQ_max = 100 pC/g * 0.4 g\nQ_max = 40 pC\n\nThe amplifier must then convert this charge to a voltage that fits within the ADC input range. Assuming a full-scale range of 5 V, you would design the charge amplifier to have a gain that achieves this. The charge amplifier gain G (in V/pC) is given by:\n\nG = V_out / Q_in\n\nFor a maximum output of 5 V:\n\nG = 5 V / 40 pC\nG = 125 V/nC\n\nIn practice, the gain would be set by selecting appropriate feedback components in the charge amplifier circuit. A common instrumentation amplifier IC can be used as the core of the charge amplifier. \n\nAdditionally, considering the 10 mV maximum acceptable offset, an op-amp with a low offset voltage should be selected, and additional offset nulling circuits or calibration procedures may be implemented.\n\nWhile the exact supply voltage limits have not been specified, a dual supply of ±15 V is common for many operational amplifiers and would typically provide sufficient headroom for the output signal.\n\nTo summarize, a charge amplifier with a gain of approximately 125 V/nC using an op-amp with low offset voltage would be suitable. If the supply voltage information becomes available, the chosen op-amp must be compatible with the supply voltage for optimal performance. \n```",

An appropriate cutoff frequency might be chosen to be around 10 Hz to provide a buffer region between the desired signal and the point where attenuation begins, ensuring minimal signal distortion within the passband.\n\nSince no specific requirements for attenuation level, phase response, or environmental conditions were provided, we will assume standard conditions and design goals:\n\n1. A Butterworth filter topology could be used for a maximally flat passband, which means no ripple in the passband and a smooth roll-off starting at 10 Hz. For a sharper transition, a Chebyshev or elliptic filter could be considered, but these introduce passband ripple and phase distortion.\n\n2. A 1st or 2nd-order filter would typically provide a -20 dB/decade or -40 dB/decade roll-off respectively after the cutoff frequency. However, without specifying the required attenuation level, we'll opt for a conservative 2nd-order filter, which generally provides a good balance between complexity and performance.\n\n3. A simple RC (Resistor-Capacitor) low-pass filter is often sufficient for low-order filtering requirements. However, for a more precise cut-off and steeper roll-off, an active filter using operational amplifiers (op-amps) might be used.\n\n4. Assuming a single supply voltage for portability, the filter design should include biasing to ensure the input and output signals are within the op-amp's linear range.\n\n5. For a 2nd-order Butterworth filter with a 10 Hz cutoff frequency, the damping factor (ζ) is 1/√2 (approximately 0.707), which is characteristic of this filter type.\n\nGiven that the requirement for phase response and environmental conditions were not provided, standard commercial-grade components could be used. For applications with environmental concerns or need for a linear phase response, specialized components and more advanced filter topologies like Bessel filters might be considered, which provide a nearly linear phase response.\n\nIn conclusion, for the low-pass filter, a standard 2nd-order Butterworth active filter could be implemented. The following values would be reasonable for a 10 Hz cutoff frequency:\n\n- Op-amp: A low noise, FET-input operational amplifier, such as the TL072, for a good balance between performance and cost.\n- Resistors (R): If we choose standard values, R1 = R2 = 15.9kΩ (to account for the gain of the op-amp and standard resistor values).\n- Capacitors (C): Using the standard formula for a Butterworth filter, C1 = C2 = 1 / (2 * π * R * 10 Hz), which would be approximately 100 nF.\n\nThese component values are suggested starting points and may need to be fine-tuned based on actual system performance and component tolerances.\n```",

We will use a sampling rate of 100 samples per second (100 S/s) which is well above the minimum requirement (4 S/s) and provides ample data points for signal analysis.\n- Resolution: Since the amplitude of the vibration is not given, we will assume a moderate resolution of 16 bits. This will give a high dynamic range to the ADC, suitable for detecting small changes in voltage from the piezoelectric sensor and converting them into a digital value.\n- Input Range: The input range will depend on the output voltage range of the charge amplifier. Without specific information, we will assume the ADC should handle a standard input range of ±10V, which is typical for industrial sensors.\n- Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): We will select an ADC with a high SNR (\u003e90 dB) and low THD to ensure the fidelity of the vibration signal capture is maintained.\n- ADC Topology: A Sigma-Delta (Σ-Δ) ADC topology would be suitable for this application as it provides high-resolution measurements, and the oversampling can inherently filter out noise, improving SNR.\n- Interface: A common serial interface such as SPI or I2C can be used. SPI is preferred for its higher speeds which may be beneficial for real-time applications.\n\nWithout further details, these are generalized recommendations.

The choice of accelerometer will depend on the expected amplitude and frequency range, ensuring it can effectively capture up to 2 Hz vibrations and translate the 5 cm peak motion into a measurable electrical charge.\n\nCharge Amplifier: This block converts the charge generated by the piezoelectric sensor into a voltage. The amplifier must be designed to handle the expected charge levels while maintaining a low noise floor. Its gain will be set to produce a usable output voltage range (e.g., 0-5 V peak-to-peak) from the expected vibration levels.\n\nLow-pass Filter: An analog low-pass filter is required to prevent aliasing before the signal is digitized by the ADC. Given the 2 Hz frequency range of interest, the filter will likely have a cutoff frequency slightly above 2 Hz (e.g., 5-10 Hz) to preserve the desired signal while attenuating higher frequency noise.\n\nADC: The analog-to-digital converter digitizes the conditioned analog signal from the low-pass filter. It should have a sufficient sampling rate (at least twice the highest frequency of interest, so at least 4 samples per second according to the Nyquist Theorem) and resolution to capture the full dynamics of the vibration.\n\nMicrocontroller/DSP: A digital processing unit, such as a microcontroller or digital signal processor (DSP), is required for further signal processing, data analysis, or communication with external devices. This block can also handle tasks like device control, user interface, and data storage/logging if needed.\n```"

Since we do not have a specific model, one can consider a general purpose accelerometer for low-frequency applications, such as the PCB Piezotronics model 352C33 or a similar model from other reputable manufacturers like Bruel \u0026 Kjaer or Kistler.\n- This type of accelerometer will have an internal preamplifier to convert the charge to a low impedance voltage output which can be processed by subsequent stages.\n\nFrequency Range:\n- The device is expected to measure vibrations up to 2 Hz.\n\nAmplitude (Peak Motion):\n- The accelerometer must be capable of detecting the specified peak motion of 5 cm. Since accelerometers measure acceleration, the corresponding acceleration for the peak motion at low frequencies would be quite small, so a high sensitivity accelerometer is appropriate.\n\nResolution:\n- The resolution is not specified, but it should be fine enough to detect the smallest discernible change in vibration that the application requires. For a general guidance, a resolution better than 0.001 g might be sufficient for detecting small variations in low-frequency vibrations.\n\nTemperature Range:\n- While not specified, we can assume the accelerometer should operate in a typical industrial temperature range, from -40°C to +85°C.\n\nPower Supply Requirements:\n- A typical IEPE (Integrated Electronics Piezoelectric) sensor, which includes a built-in preamplifier, typically requires a constant current power supply, usually in the range of 2 to 20 mA at a supply voltage between 18 to 30 VDC.\n\nSensitivity:\n- As indicated, the sensitivity is 100 pC/g. This parameter is crucial for designing the charge amplifier, as it determines the output voltage per unit of acceleration.\n\nEnvironmental Conditions:\n- Although not specified, one could assume a general industrial environment. Thus, the accelerometer should be suitably sealed (IP65 or better) against dust and moisture and capable of withstanding normal handling and operation.\n\nCertifications:\n- No specific certifications are required, but it is recommended to choose a sensor that complies with common industrial standards for reliability and durability.\n\nAttention should be paid to:\n- The mechanical mounting and coupling of the accelerometer to ensure accurate vibration measurements.\n- Ensuring the accelerometer's operating temperature range is suitable for the application.\n- Verifying the accelerometer's frequency response is flat within the desired frequency range, or understanding any deviations so they can be accounted for in data interpretation.\n- Defining a clear resolution requirement to select an accelerometer that meets the application’s needs.\n\nSummary:\nA general-purpose high-sensitivity IEPE piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 100 pC/g and a suitable frequency response for up to 2 Hz will be selected. The model chosen should ideally have a resolution fine enough for the application, a suitable temperature range, and be robust for industrial use. Power requirements are typically within the range for IEPE sensors, and the sensor should be compatible with common industrial standards.\n```"

The maximum expected acceleration can be deduced from the peak displacement (5 cm) and the frequency (2 Hz) using the formula:\n\na_max = (2 * π * f)^2 * d\n\nwhere:\na_max = maximum acceleration (in g)\nf = frequency (in Hz)\nd = displacement (in cm)\n\nConverting 5 cm to meters and plugging in the values:\n\na_max = (2 * π * 2)^2 * 0.05\na_max ≈ 0.4 g\n\nNow, the output charge from the sensor at 0.4 g would be:\n\nQ_max = Sensitivity * a_max\nQ_max = 100 pC/g * 0.4 g\nQ_max = 40 pC\n\nThe amplifier must then convert this charge to a voltage that fits within the ADC input range. Assuming a full-scale range of 5 V, you would design the charge amplifier to have a gain that achieves this. The charge amplifier gain G (in V/pC) is given by:\n\nG = V_out / Q_in\n\nFor a maximum output of 5 V:\n\nG = 5 V / 40 pC\nG = 125 V/nC\n\nIn practice, the gain would be set by selecting appropriate feedback components in the charge amplifier circuit. A common instrumentation amplifier IC can be used as the core of the charge amplifier. \n\nAdditionally, considering the 10 mV maximum acceptable offset, an op-amp with a low offset voltage should be selected, and additional offset nulling circuits or calibration procedures may be implemented.\n\nWhile the exact supply voltage limits have not been specified, a dual supply of ±15 V is common for many operational amplifiers and would typically provide sufficient headroom for the output signal.\n\nTo summarize, a charge amplifier with a gain of approximately 125 V/nC using an op-amp with low offset voltage would be suitable. If the supply voltage information becomes available, the chosen op-amp must be compatible with the supply voltage for optimal performance. \n```"

An appropriate cutoff frequency might be chosen to be around 10 Hz to provide a buffer region between the desired signal and the point where attenuation begins, ensuring minimal signal distortion within the passband.\n\nSince no specific requirements for attenuation level, phase response, or environmental conditions were provided, we will assume standard conditions and design goals:\n\n1. A Butterworth filter topology could be used for a maximally flat passband, which means no ripple in the passband and a smooth roll-off starting at 10 Hz. For a sharper transition, a Chebyshev or elliptic filter could be considered, but these introduce passband ripple and phase distortion.\n\n2. A 1st or 2nd-order filter would typically provide a -20 dB/decade or -40 dB/decade roll-off respectively after the cutoff frequency. However, without specifying the required attenuation level, we'll opt for a conservative 2nd-order filter, which generally provides a good balance between complexity and performance.\n\n3. A simple RC (Resistor-Capacitor) low-pass filter is often sufficient for low-order filtering requirements. However, for a more precise cut-off and steeper roll-off, an active filter using operational amplifiers (op-amps) might be used.\n\n4. Assuming a single supply voltage for portability, the filter design should include biasing to ensure the input and output signals are within the op-amp's linear range.\n\n5. For a 2nd-order Butterworth filter with a 10 Hz cutoff frequency, the damping factor (ζ) is 1/√2 (approximately 0.707), which is characteristic of this filter type.\n\nGiven that the requirement for phase response and environmental conditions were not provided, standard commercial-grade components could be used. For applications with environmental concerns or need for a linear phase response, specialized components and more advanced filter topologies like Bessel filters might be considered, which provide a nearly linear phase response.\n\nIn conclusion, for the low-pass filter, a standard 2nd-order Butterworth active filter could be implemented. The following values would be reasonable for a 10 Hz cutoff frequency:\n\n- Op-amp: A low noise, FET-input operational amplifier, such as the TL072, for a good balance between performance and cost.\n- Resistors (R): If we choose standard values, R1 = R2 = 15.9kΩ (to account for the gain of the op-amp and standard resistor values).\n- Capacitors (C): Using the standard formula for a Butterworth filter, C1 = C2 = 1 / (2 * π * R * 10 Hz), which would be approximately 100 nF.\n\nThese component values are suggested starting points and may need to be fine-tuned based on actual system performance and component tolerances.\n```"

We will use a sampling rate of 100 samples per second (100 S/s) which is well above the minimum requirement (4 S/s) and provides ample data points for signal analysis.\n- Resolution: Since the amplitude of the vibration is not given, we will assume a moderate resolution of 16 bits. This will give a high dynamic range to the ADC, suitable for detecting small changes in voltage from the piezoelectric sensor and converting them into a digital value.\n- Input Range: The input range will depend on the output voltage range of the charge amplifier. Without specific information, we will assume the ADC should handle a standard input range of ±10V, which is typical for industrial sensors.\n- Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): We will select an ADC with a high SNR (\u003e90 dB) and low THD to ensure the fidelity of the vibration signal capture is maintained.\n- ADC Topology: A Sigma-Delta (Σ-Δ) ADC topology would be suitable for this application as it provides high-resolution measurements, and the oversampling can inherently filter out noise, improving SNR.\n- Interface: A common serial interface such as SPI or I2C can be used. SPI is preferred for its higher speeds which may be beneficial for real-time applications.\n\nWithout further details, these are generalized recommendations.

Maximum acceleration (a_max) from peak displacement (d) at frequency (f):\n   a_max = (2 * π * f)^2 * d\n   a_max = (2 * π * 2)^2 * 0.05 m\n   a_max ≈ 0.4 g\n\n2. Output charge (Q_max) from the sensor:\n   Q_max = Sensitivity * a_max\n   Q_max = 100 pC/g * 0.4 g\n   Q_max = 40 pC\n\n3. Charge Amplifier Gain (G):\n   G = V_out / Q_in\n   G = 5 V / 40 pC\n   G = 125 V/nC\n\n4. Low-pass Filter Component Values:\n   Cutoff frequency (fc): 10 Hz\n   R = 15.9kΩ (standard value)\n   C = 1 / (2 * π * R * fc)\n   C ≈ 100 nF\n\nNote that the above calculations and component value selections are based on typical industry standards and assumptions made due to the lack of specific user requirements. These may need to be adjusted based on the actual sensor model, environmental conditions, and detailed application requirements.\n```",
