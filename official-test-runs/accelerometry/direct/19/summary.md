Portable Low-Frequency Vibration Measurement Device Design

OVERALL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
The system is designed around core blocks including a Piezoelectric Accelerometer, Charge Amplifier, Low-Pass Filter, Anti-Aliasing Filter, ADC, Microcontroller, and Output Interface, arranged in a signal chain that processes the physical vibration signal into a digital form suitable for analysis and presentation.

PIEZOELECTRIC ACCELEROMETER:
- Model Suggestion: PCB Piezotronics 352A21 (or similar with equivalent specifications)
- Sensitivity: 100 pC/g
- Frequency Response: Flat from 0.25 Hz up to at least 2 Hz
- Temperature Range: -40°C to +85°C (typical for industrial applications)
- Output Type: Charge output

CHARGE AMPLIFIER:
- Topology: Feedback charge amplifier with a FET input op-amp for high input impedance and low bias current
- Op-Amp Suggestion: AD8628, OPAx177
- Feedback Capacitor (C_f): 0.47 pF (chosen for standard value close to calculated 0.51 pF)
- Feedback Resistor (R_f): 1.5 GΩ (chosen for a standard high-value resistor)
- Power Supply: ±5V or single 5V supply
- Gain: Defined by feedback components to ensure 1 Vpp output from accelerometer charge

LOW-PASS FILTER:
- Type: Active Butterworth Low-Pass
- Order: 2nd order for a -3 dB point at 0.25 Hz
- Cutoff Frequency (f_c): 2 Hz
- Component Selection:
  - Resistors: R1 = R2 = 795.8 kΩ (approximated to 796 kΩ for standard value)
  - Capacitors: C1 = C2 = 0.1 µF (for simplicity in calculations)
- Op-Amp: Low-noise, precision op-amp like OPA2134 or LT1057

ANTI-ALIASING FILTER:
- Type: Active Butterworth Low-Pass
- Order: 2nd order
- Cutoff Frequency (f_c): 3 Hz (chosen for a slight oversampling margin)
- Component Selection:
  - Resistors: R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ
  - Capacitors: C1 = C2 = 0.53 µF (standard value closest to calculated is 0.47 µF)

ADC:
- Type: Sigma-Delta (Σ-Δ), suitable for low-frequency and high-resolution applications
- Resolution: 16-bit or higher for accurate measurement
- Sampling Rate: 10 samples per second (SPS) minimum, oversampling is beneficial
- Interface: SPI or I2C for easy integration with microcontrollers
- Power Consumption: Low power, suitable for portable battery-operated devices

MICROCONTROLLER:
- Selection: ARM Cortex-M series for a balance of power efficiency and processing capability
- Features: Adequate RAM and flash memory, built-in ADC (if separate ADC isn't used), communication interfaces
- Software: Use of development IDEs like Keil µVision, STM32CubeIDE; DSP libraries like ARM's CMSIS-DSP for FFT
- Communication Protocols: UART or USB for data transfer, possibly Bluetooth for wireless connectivity

OUTPUT INTERFACE:
- Display: SSD1306 OLED module for real-time data display
- Digital Communication: USB to UART bridge (e.g., FT232RL) for data logging, BLE module (e.g., HM-10) or SoC (e.g., nRF52832) for wireless data transmission
- Data Logging: SD card slot for standalone logging capabilities, using SPI or SDIO interface
- Power Management: Charging circuit and power management IC for battery life optimization
- User Controls: Buttons for device operation and menu navigation

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
- Calibration routines and adjustable components are included to compensate for sensor and system offsets.
- Robust design is considered for portable operation, including environmental and mechanical resilience.
- Power efficiency is emphasized across all design stages to support portability.
- The layout and component choices will be further refined based on detailed design specification and prototyping results.
