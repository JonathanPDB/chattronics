Verdict: generic

Explanations: 
The project summary describes an analog instrumentation system for pressure and temperature monitoring with various subsystems for each type of measurement. However, it fails to meet several of the specified requirements:

1. Both sensors are stated to have d.c. output, so no demodulation is used. This requirement is met.
2. Both sensors are amplified, as indicated by the use of an instrumentation amplifier for the pressure sensor and a logarithmic amplifier for the temperature sensor. This requirement is met.
3. The pressure sensor is indeed inserted in a Wheatstone bridge and amplified by an instrumentation amplifier. This requirement is met.
4. An ADC is used in the form of a 12-bit SAR ADC. This requirement is met.
5. The infrared radiation sensor is linearized using a logarithmic amplifier. This requirement is met.
6. The summary does not explicitly mention the sampling order strategy (sequential, simultaneous, etc.). This requirement is not met.
7. The ADC is capable of sampling multiple channels indicating that it does not do it all in the same channel. This requirement seems to be met.
8. The ADC's sampling frequency is not explicitly mentioned but given the total throughput capability of 32 kSPS for 16 channels, this implies a per-channel rate of 2000 Hz, which meets the requirement of not being less than 800 Hz. This requirement is met.
9. The ADC's sampling frequency per channel exceeds 2000 Hz based on the total throughput rate and the number of channels. This requirement is met.
10. The ADC is specified as an SAR type. This requirement is met.
11. The low-pass cutoff frequency for the pressure sensor is incorrectly stated as 350 Hz, which does not meet the requirement of being higher than 400 Hz. The temperature sensor's filter cutoff is stated to be just above the signal frequency of interest, but no specific value is provided, leaving it unclear whether it meets the requirement of being lower than half the total sampling frequency. This requirement is not fully met.
12. Low-pass filters are mentioned, but there is no indication that they are positioned before the multiplexers to reduce aliasing. This requirement is not met.
13. The project uses a 16-channel analog multiplexer. This requirement is met.
14. The multiplexer used is a solid-state device. This requirement is met.

The lack of a clear sampling order strategy, an incorrect low-pass filter cutoff frequency for the pressure sensor, and the absence of a specified positioning of the low-pass filters before the multiplexers result in the project not meeting all the necessary requirements. Additionally, the low-pass filter cutoff frequencies are either incorrect or not adequately specified. Therefore, the project cannot be classified as "optimal."

Given that the project has some fatal flaws, mainly the incorrect low-pass filter cutoff frequency and the lack of detail on the positioning of the low-pass filters and the sampling order strategy, it cannot be classified as "acceptable" either.

The project cannot be "unfeasible" since the design elements described are theoretically correct and could be implemented with modifications.

The project is not "incorrect" as the information provided is conceptually sound, just lacking in meeting some of the requirements.

Therefore, the project is best classified as "generic" because while it is theoretically correct and can be implemented, it is too generic to have real value without additional specification and correction to meet all the requirements.
