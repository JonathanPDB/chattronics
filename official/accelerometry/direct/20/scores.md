Explanations: 
1. The product of the feedback resistance (R_f) and the feedback capacitance (C_f) is calculated as 4.7 MΩ * 150 pF = 705 µs. The target value is 2/pi (approximately 0.637), so we need to check the time constant in seconds: 705 µs = 0.705 ms. This is not within 10% of the desired 0.637 ms (2/pi in milliseconds). Hence, this requirement is not met.

2. The charge amplifier gain (G) is 10^4 V/C. When multiplied by 1.61E-12 and divided by the feedback capacitance (C_f) of 150 pF, we get G * 1.61E-12 / C_f = (10^4 * 1.61E-12) / 150E-12 = 1.61E-4 / 150E-12 = 1.07. This is within 10% of the desired value of 1, so this requirement is met.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is not explicitly stated in the summary, so we cannot confirm if this requirement is met.

4. The bias current is not provided in the summary, so this requirement is not met.

5. The relationship between the bias current and the feedback resistance is not given, so this requirement is not met.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, so this requirement is met.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation with a low-pass filter at 0.25 Hz, not 2 Hz, and no calculations are provided for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude. Therefore, this requirement is not met.

8. The output voltage is stated to be 1 V peak to peak, which meets this requirement.

9. The offset voltage is not explicitly stated to be below 10 mV, but a low offset voltage op-amp is used (e.g., OPAx277 series). This does not guarantee that the offset is below 10 mV without further information, so we cannot confirm this requirement is met.
