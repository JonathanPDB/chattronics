Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The design of the analog monitoring system for pressure and temperature meets most of the requirements, but there are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. The pressure sensor output is DC, which satisfies the first requirement.
2. Both the pressure and temperature sensors are amplified, meeting the second requirement.
3. The pressure sensor is included in a Wheatstone bridge and amplified by an instrumentation amplifier, fulfilling the third requirement.
4. An ADC with a sampling rate of ≥2 kHz per channel is used, which exceeds the minimum requirement of 800 Hz, satisfying the seventh requirement.
5. The infrared temperature sensor has a digital I²C interface, which seems to contradict the requirement for linearization through diode networks or log amplifiers. However, it is mentioned that the sensor array includes non-contact infrared detectors, which may imply that there are other elements in the array that could be linearized as required. This point is not entirely clear, so it's difficult to ascertain if the fifth requirement is fully met.
6. The design does not explicitly mention the sampling order strategy (sequential, simultaneous, etc.), which is a requirement for a complete review.
7. The anti-aliasing filter for the pressure sensor has a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz, which is at the lower limit of what is acceptable. The requirement states that the cutoff frequency must be higher than 400 Hz, so this is just on the edge of being acceptable. However, there is no explicit mention of the filter's performance at half the sampling frequency regarding the -20 dB gain, so it's unclear if the eighth requirement is met.
8. The ninth requirement is partially addressed with the 400 Hz cutoff frequency, but since the exact sampling frequency is not mentioned, it's not possible to confirm if the cutoff is less than half the total sampling frequency.
9. Low-pass filters are indeed positioned before the multiplexer, meeting the tenth requirement.
10. The project uses a multiplexer, as required by the eleventh requirement.
11. The multiplexer is solid-state, in line with the twelfth requirement.

Overall, the design is on the right track but lacks explicit confirmation on some of the necessary requirements, such as the linearization method for the infrared sensors and the exact performance of the anti-aliasing filters at half the sampling frequency. The absence of a specified sampling order strategy and the cutoff frequency being exactly at the lower limit also detract from the design's completeness.
