They also provide signal conditioning to improve signal quality.\n\n- **Amplifier[1-8]**: These are gain stage amplifiers used to amplify the temperature sensor signals to a level suitable for further processing.\n\n- **Filter[1-16]**: These are low-pass filters with a cutoff frequency just above 400 Hz to remove unwanted high-frequency noise and signals, ensuring the ADC samples only the relevant signal frequencies.\n\n- **Multiplexer1** and **Multiplexer2**: These are analog multiplexers that select one channel at a time from the pressure and temperature sensor signal conditioning chains, respectively, and feed it to the sample and hold circuits.\n\n- **SampleAndHold1** and **SampleAndHold2**: These circuits capture and hold the voltage level of their input signals at a certain moment in time, ensuring a stable signal is provided to the ADC during the conversion process.\n\n- **ADC1**: This is a high-resolution analog-to-digital converter that digitizes the analog signals from the sample and hold circuits. It needs to have enough resolution to ensure at least 1% accuracy for both sensors, and it must have a sampling rate capable of handling input frequencies up to 400 Hz.\n\n- **DataBuffer**: This block represents a temporary storage area for the digitized data before it is sent to the computer. It ensures that the data is organized and accessible for the computer interface.\n\n- **ComputerInterface**: This block represents the interface hardware that handles communication between the data acquisition system and the computer, such as a USB, PCI, or Ethernet interface.\n```"
