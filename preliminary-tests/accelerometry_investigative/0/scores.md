Score: 3
Explanations: 
The project summary provides comprehensive details about the design of a portable low-frequency vibration measurement device, but it does not explicitly address all the requirements listed. Let's evaluate the requirements:

1. The feedback resistance times the feedback capacitance must be roughly around 2/pi. Given Rf = 1 MÎ© and Cf = 820 pF, the product Rf * Cf = 1e6 * 820e-12 = 820e-6 = 0.82 ms. The value 2/pi is approximately 0.637, so this requirement is not met.

2. 1.61 pico divided by the feedback capacitance times the gain (G x 1.61p / Cf) should be roughly around 1. With Cf = 820 pF and a gain of approximately 625, G x 1.61p / Cf = 625 * 1.61e-12 / 820e-12 = 1.23, which is not roughly around 1.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be around 161 pC. The maximum expected charge Qmax is calculated to be 402.5 pC, which does not meet the requirement of 161 pC.

4. The bias current must be provided. The summary does not provide any information about the bias current, so this requirement is not met.

5. 0.01 divided by the feedback resistance must equal the bias current. Without information on the bias current, this requirement cannot be verified.

6. The project uses a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor. This requirement is met, as the summary describes the use of a charge amplifier with a feedback capacitor and resistor.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2Hz and 5cm amplitude and has calculations to back it up. The summary does include calculations for an expected vibration amplitude, but it is not clear if 5cm amplitude is considered. The optimization for 2Hz is implied by the cutoff frequencies of the filters, but without explicit mention of the 5cm amplitude, this requirement is not fully met.

8. The output voltage is 1V peak to peak. The summary states that the gain stage is calculated to amplify the maximum accelerometer output to 1 Vpp, meeting this requirement.

9. The offset is less than 10mV. The project summary does not provide any information regarding the voltage offset, so this requirement is not met.

Based on the above, the project meets 3 out of the 9 listed requirements.
