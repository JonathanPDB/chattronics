1. The NTC is linearized
2. Linearization is using a resistor in parallel with the sensor.
3. The sensor is placed in a wheatstone bridge.
4. The signal is amplified before measurement.
5. The voltage range of the output is provided, as well as the needed gain.
6. The self-heating effect of the thermistor is taking into account and mitigated.
7. The measurement is made with a multimeter and there is no digital part.
