Analog Temperature Measurement System for Water in a Beaker

Thermistor Sensor:
- Sensor: Vishay NTCLE100E3 NTC thermistor
- Typical Resistance at 25°C: 10 kΩ (Assumed for calculations)
- Operating Temperature Range: 10°C to 90°C
- Thermal Time Constant: 5 to 15 seconds (Assumed)
- Dissipation Constant: 1 to 3 mW/°C (Assumed)
- Waterproofing may be required if the thermistor is immersed directly in water

Linearization Resistor Network:
- Linearization at the midpoint of the temperature range (50°C)
- Method: Parallel resistor with the thermistor (Rlin) to linearize response
- Assumed Rlin ≈ Resistance of NTC at 50°C
- Calculation of Rlin: Exact value to be determined from the thermistor's datasheet or by estimation using the B-value formula
- Voltage Divider Power Supply: Value not specified; assume a supply voltage that allows a voltage range of 0-20V at the output

Buffer Amplifier:
- Configuration: Voltage follower (unity-gain buffer)
- Operational Amplifier: Low-noise, precision op-amp (e.g., OPA340 or equivalent)
- Input Impedance: >1 MΩ
- Output Impedance: <100 Ω
- Bandwidth: Approximately 10 Hz
- Power Supply: Single-supply voltage of 5V or dual ±15V (Assumed for calculations)

Instrumentation Amplifier:
- Operational Amplifier: Suitable for gain setting (e.g., INA114 or AD620)
- Gain: 25 (V/V) (Assumed from estimated sensitivity 10mV/°C across the thermistor network)
- Power Supply: Dual ±15V (Assumed for calculations)
- CMRR: At least 80dB (Assumed)

Low-Pass Filter:
- Topology: Second-order active low-pass filter (Butterworth response)
- Operational Amplifier: Low-noise, precision op-amp with bandwidth >10 times the cutoff frequency
- Cutoff Frequency: 1 Hz
- Resistors: 10 kΩ precision resistors (1% or better tolerance)
- Capacitors: 15 µF precision capacitors (1% or better tolerance)

Voltage Output:
- Output Range: 0-20V
- Multimeter Requirements: High input impedance (>1MΩ), resolution capable of reading small voltage changes (at least 10mV resolution)
- Calibration: To ensure gain accuracy, calibration against a known temperature reference is recommended
- Protection: Implementation of surge protection or fuses for the safety of the system and the user

Please note: All component values and assumptions made in the absence of specific information must be confirmed with actual datasheet values and user requirements before final implementation. Calibration of the system is critical for accurate temperature measurements.
