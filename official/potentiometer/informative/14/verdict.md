Verdict: acceptable

Explanations: 
The project design for the Pendulum Angle Measurement System mostly aligns with the requirements given, but there are some issues that need to be addressed:

1. The potentiometer is correctly used as a voltage divider and is suitable for the application.
2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer is within the specified +/- 10 V range.
3. The architecture is simple and includes a voltage divider, a buffer stage, and an anti-aliasing filter before the DAQ stage.
4. The input voltage of the DAQ is centered at 0, with the buffer stage gain set to 0.7 to scale the voltage to +/- 7V, which matches the requirement.
5. The maximum voltage applied to the DAQ is managed to be 7V, which is necessary.
6. There is a mention of a low-pass filter to avoid aliasing, but the cutoff frequency specified (150 Hz to 200 Hz) is not in line with the requirement that it must have a gain of at least -20 dB at 500 Hz.
7. The notch filter design is proposed to remove frequencies around 50 and 60 Hz, which satisfies the requirement.
8. The order and cutoff frequency of the filter do not guarantee that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, as the specified low-pass filter cutoff is between 150 Hz and 200 Hz, which may not be sufficient to attenuate the gain to -20 dB by 500 Hz.

While most of the design is in line with the requirements, the anti-aliasing filter's cutoff frequency is not explicitly stated to meet the -20 dB gain at 500 Hz criteria. Additional information or adjustment is needed to ensure that the anti-aliasing filter will indeed provide the required attenuation at 500 Hz. Therefore, the project is not optimal but can be considered acceptable with minor adjustments to the filter design.
