Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project summary outlines a pendulum angle measurement system that incorporates a linear potentiometer as a position sensor, a signal conditioning circuit to match the DAQ's input range, a buffer amplifier, an anti-aliasing filter, and an ADC for digital data acquisition. 

The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider, satisfying requirement 1. The operating voltage of up to 10V is within the specified +/- 10V range, meeting requirement 2. The architecture is simple and includes the voltage divider, buffer, and anti-aliasing filter before DAQ measurement, adhering to requirement 3.

The signal conditioning circuit is designed to ensure that the voltage at the DAQ is centered at 0V and does not exceed +/- 7V, which is in line with requirements 4 and 5. 

The anti-aliasing filter, recommended to be a 2nd or 3rd order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency between 200 Hz and 250 Hz, will help avoid aliasing, thus fulfilling requirement 6. However, there is no specific mention of a filter to remove frequencies around 50 to 60 Hz, which is essential for eliminating power line noise; this is a critical omission that does not meet requirement 7.

Finally, the filter's cutoff frequency and order are not specified to ensure that the gain of the signal is at least -20 dB at 500 Hz, which is necessary to meet requirement 8. The recommended cutoff frequencies and filter orders are likely too low to guarantee this level of attenuation at 500 Hz, and the roll-off rate provided is not sufficient to ensure the required attenuation without further information on the specific design of the filter.

In conclusion, while the design addresses several key requirements, it fails to explicitly include a filter to remove 50 to 60 Hz power line noise and does not provide sufficient detail to confirm that the filter's performance will meet the -20 dB gain requirement at 500 Hz.
