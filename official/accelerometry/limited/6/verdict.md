Verdict: unfeasible

Explanations: 
The project summary provided for the portable low-frequency vibration measurement device has several points of interest regarding the requirements:

1. The feedback resistance (R_f) and feedback capacitance (C_f) are not explicitly stated to meet the 2/pi requirement. The chosen R_f is 620 MÎ©, but the C_f value that would satisfy the first requirement isn't provided.

2. The gain (G) of the charge amplifier is not clearly specified, and therefore the calculation involving the gain, feedback capacitance, and the constant 1.61E-12 cannot be verified.

3. The peak-to-peak charge output is calculated to be 5 pC, which deviates significantly from the required 161 pC.

4. The bias current is not provided.

5. The relationship between the bias current and feedback resistance is not established as required.

6. The project does use a charge amplifier to condition the piezoelectric sensor, which is consistent with the requirements.

7. The project is optimized for an input oscillation of 2 Hz and 5 cm amplitude, but the calculations to back this up are not detailed in the summary.

8. The output voltage is assumed to be 1 V peak to peak based on the feedback capacitance choice, but this is not confirmed with actual measurements or calculations.

9. The offset voltage is not mentioned, so it cannot be determined if it is kept below 10 mV.

Based on these observations, the project summary does not provide enough information to fully evaluate the design against all requirements. Key elements are missing or not clearly defined, such as the explicit values for R_f and C_f that meet the 2/pi requirement, the bias current specification, and the relationship between the bias current and feedback resistance. Additionally, the peak-to-peak charge output and gain-related calculation are not in line with the specified requirements.
